# Deterministic Simulation Testing for Motoko Agent Loop Compaction

Date: 2026-06-27
Status: Research draft
Related: `.agent/plans/DST_v1_Motoko_Core.md`, PR #75 compaction branch

## Summary

Deterministic Simulation Testing (DST) is a strong fit for Motoko behaviors that are hard to test with ordinary unit tests and expensive or flaky to test against real providers. The current compaction branch is a good example: the correctness claim depends on a sequence of loop states, provider token telemetry, extension hooks, system-message handling, tool-call preservation, and compaction policy.

The recommended approach is to build a deterministic loop simulator around `loop_v2` with scripted providers and inspectable call records. The simulator should not try to imitate a full LLM. It should model the narrow external contracts that drive agent-loop state transitions:

- provider responses, including `input_tokens`, `output_tokens`, `finish_reason`, message content, and tool calls
- extension hook decisions, especially `on_pre_step`
- tool policy and tool handling outcomes
- generated tool results and their message shape
- emitted events, if practical
- final provider-call message arrays

For PR #75, the highest-value DST target is proving that actual provider `input_tokens` from step N drive compaction before step N+1, while system messages stay pinned outside both extension and structural compaction.

## Problem

The behavior under test is not one pure function. It is a state transition across several loop iterations.

PR #75 changes three important surfaces:

- `src/core/compaction.ail`
  - counts serialized `tool_calls` size in `estimate_tokens_messages`
  - uses `context_limit - 75000` as effective input budget
  - adds `compact_step_actual(msgs, model, actual_input)`
  - drives compaction tiers from provider-reported input tokens when available
- `src/core/agent_loop_v2.ail`
  - tracks `last_input_tokens` in `LoopTotals`
  - partitions system messages away from mutable conversation history
  - invokes extension compaction and structural compaction only on conversation messages
  - prepends system messages back before provider calls
- `.motoko/config/ollama/compaction_ai.json`
  - changes local AI compaction defaults

Ordinary tests can cover the pure compaction helpers, but they do not prove the loop-level claim:

1. Step N provider call returns an actual `input_tokens` count.
2. The loop stores that exact value.
3. Step N+1 pre-step compaction uses that value instead of a character estimate.
4. The right compaction tier fires.
5. System prompts are not exposed to compaction extensions or structural elision.
6. Provider calls still receive the system prefix.
7. Tool-call and tool-result correlation fields survive elision.

Real-provider tests can exercise this, but they are poor primary regression tests. They depend on provider availability, auth, model-specific token accounting, network behavior, model behavior, and expensive long-context prompts.

DST gives us exact, repeatable pressure on the state machine.

## Testing Model

The simulator should treat the agent loop as a deterministic state machine:

```text
State_n =
  messages
  totals
  step_idx
  provider_script
  extension_runtime
  tool_runtime

State_n --pre_step/compact/provider/tool_dispatch--> State_n+1
```

The simulator does not need realistic prose. It needs realistic protocol shape.

### Inputs Controlled by the Simulator

- initial messages, including one or more system messages
- model name, so `context_limit_for(model)` is deterministic
- scripted provider results
- scripted extension `on_pre_step` behavior
- scripted tool handling behavior
- step budget
- cost rates and cost cap

### Outputs Captured by the Simulator

- every provider-call message list
- every extension `on_pre_step` input message list
- compaction events, if observable
- final messages
- final `LoopTotals`
- termination status

The most important missing capability in the current stub path is provider-call inspection. `src/core/test/stub_step.ail` can script returned `StepResult`s, but `dispatch_step` does not currently record the `msgs` passed into the provider. DST for compaction should add an inspectable provider seam or a test-only recorder.

## Core Invariants

These invariants should be checked over deterministic scenarios and later over seeded generated scenarios.

### System Message Pinning

System messages are constants, not mutable conversation history.

Invariants:

- `on_pre_step` receives no message with `role == "system"`.
- structural compaction receives no message with `role == "system"`.
- every provider call receives the original system prefix before conversation messages.
- provider-call system-message order is stable.
- system-message content is byte-identical to the initial system content.

This directly targets `partition_system_msgs` and the re-prepend at the provider call.

### Actual Tokens Drive Compaction

When `last_input_tokens > 0`, compaction tier selection should be driven by that value, not by local estimate.

For `ollama/qwen3...`, `context_limit_for` returns `262144`; with 75k output headroom, effective input budget is:

```text
262144 - 75000 = 187144
```

Approximate actual-token thresholds:

```text
60% = 112286
75% = 140358
85% = 159072
```

Invariants:

- `actual_input <= 0` falls back to estimate-based `compact_step`.
- `actual_input < 60% effective` does not elide old tool results.
- `actual_input >= 60% effective` keeps the last 10 tool results.
- `actual_input >= 75% effective` keeps the last 5 tool results.
- `actual_input >= 85% effective` enters emergency compaction.
- emergency entry is actual-token-gated, but emergency success/exhaustion is estimate-gated by `usage_percent` after elision.
- `effective <= 0` fails open in both estimate and actual-token paths; this includes `test/tiny` and any model whose context limit is at or below the 75k headroom.

The critical DST scenario is a message list whose estimated size is small but whose previous `input_tokens` is above threshold. That proves the actual-token path is load-bearing.

### Tool Shape Preservation

Compaction may shorten old tool-result content, but it must not corrupt protocol correlation.

Invariants:

- list length is preserved by structural elision
- message order is preserved
- each tool message keeps its `tool_call_id`
- assistant `tool_calls` keep `id`, `name`, and `arguments`
- non-tool messages are not elided by `elide_old_tool_results`
- recent tool-result content is preserved according to the tier

### Headroom Policy

Usage percentage should be calculated against effective input budget, not the full provider context window.

Invariants:

- unknown model returns 0% usage
- models with `context_limit <= 75000` return 0% usage
- known large-context models calculate usage against `limit - 75000`
- `tool_calls.arguments` contributes to token estimate even when message `content` is small

Two tier tables must be tested:

- estimate fallback path, used when `last_input_tokens <= 0`: 70% keep-last-10, 85% keep-last-5, 95% emergency
- actual-token path, used when `last_input_tokens > 0` and effective context is positive: 60% keep-last-10, 75% keep-last-5, 85% emergency


## Scenario Tests for PR #75

### Scenario 1: Carry Forward Actual Tokens

Purpose: prove step N token telemetry controls step N+1 compaction.

Initial state:

```text
messages:
  system: "AILANG reference"
  user: "task"
  old tool results: 12 long tool messages

provider script:
  step 1: finish_reason = "tool_calls", input_tokens = 140359
  step 2: finish_reason = "stop", input_tokens = 100
```

Expected:

- step 1 provider call has no actual-token-driven compaction if `last_input_tokens == 0`; estimate-fallback compaction may still fire if the fixture is large enough
- loop stores `last_input_tokens = 140359`
- before step 2 provider call, `compact_step_actual` uses the 75% actual-token tier
- in the step 2 provider-call payload, old tool messages outside the last 5 are elided and the last 5 are preserved
- system message still appears at the beginning of the step 2 provider-call payload
- returned/persisted loop history remains full and uncompacted
- DST records the under-pressure relationship: `last_input_tokens` measured the previous compacted provider payload, while the next compaction tier is applied to the full uncompacted history


### Scenario 2: Actual Tokens Beat Estimate

Purpose: catch regressions where code accidentally returns to `usage_percent(msgs, model)`.

Initial state:

```text
messages:
  system: "stable system"
  user: "small"
  12 tool messages with short content

totals.last_input_tokens:
  140359
```

Expected:

- compaction fires even though local estimate is below threshold
- provider sees tier-2 compacted conversation

This requires either direct test access to `compact_step_actual` or a one-step loop harness that can seed `LoopTotals`.

### Scenario 3: System Hidden From Malicious Extension

Purpose: prove extension compaction cannot drop or rewrite system instructions.

Fake extension:

```text
on_pre_step(msgs):
  assert no system messages are present
  return Compacted([], "drop everything")
```

Expected:

- extension input has no system messages
- provider still receives original system messages
- provider receives no conversation messages except any later loop-added ones

This tests the stronger property: even an aggressive compaction extension cannot remove the system prefix.

### Scenario 4: Tool Call Arguments Counted

Purpose: cover the original undercount class for write/edit operations.

Messages:

```text
assistant:
  content = ""
  tool_calls = [
    {
      name = "WriteFile",
      arguments = huge JSON payload
    }
  ]
```

Expected:

- `estimate_tokens_messages` increases according to `name + arguments`
- a content-only estimator would remain near zero; the new estimator does not

This can remain a pure helper test, but it belongs in the same DST suite as a regression guard.

### Scenario 5: Emergency Refusal

Purpose: verify the loop terminates with `ContextExhausted` only when emergency elision cannot recover.

Initial state:

```text
actual_input >= 85% effective
messages include enough large non-tool content that chars/7 usage remains >=95% after tool-result elision
```

Expected:

- emergency compaction tries keep-last-3 and keep-last-1
- if usage remains >=95% after elision (measured by the chars/7 ESTIMATE, not actual_input), loop returns `ContextExhausted`
- run summary reason includes `compaction_exhausted`

## Follow-up PR #76: Harness Prompt Materialization

PR #76 fixed a related but different failure mode: `SYSTEM_MD` could point outside the task workspace, while the AILANG runtime was FS-sandboxed to `WORKDIR` through `AILANG_FS_SANDBOX`. In that case `rpc.ail` could preserve and pin the system message correctly, but the prompt content was empty from the start because the runtime could not read the external file. The observed symptom was `system_prompt_built` reporting `chars=0`.

This bug is catchable by DST, but not by a `loop_v2`-only simulator. It lives one boundary earlier: the TypeScript harness must materialize runtime inputs into the sandbox before spawning AILANG.

The useful abstraction is "sandbox materialization DST":

```text
Parent process state:
  WORKDIR = /tmp/workspace-A
  SYSTEM_MD = /tmp/external/system.md
  AILANG_FS_SANDBOX = /tmp/workspace-A

Harness transition:
  materialize readable runtime inputs into WORKDIR
  rewrite env vars to sandbox-readable paths
  spawn child process

Child observable:
  SYSTEM_MD points inside WORKDIR
  file exists
  file content equals original external prompt
  system_prompt_built chars > 0
```

### Scenario 6: External SYSTEM_MD Is Materialized

Purpose: catch the PR #76 bug class.

Simulator setup:

```text
workspace:
  /tmp/motoko-dst/workdir/

external prompt:
  /tmp/motoko-dst/prompts/SYSTEM.md
  content = "AILANG reference sentinel: dst-system-prompt"

env:
  WORKDIR=/tmp/motoko-dst/workdir
  SYSTEM_MD=/tmp/motoko-dst/prompts/SYSTEM.md
```

Expected after harness preparation:

- `process.env.SYSTEM_MD` is rewritten to a path under `WORKDIR`
- rewritten file exists
- rewritten file content exactly equals the external prompt
- child env includes `AILANG_FS_SANDBOX=WORKDIR`
- a sandboxed child read of `SYSTEM_MD` succeeds

This can be tested without a real model. A minimal child process can read `SYSTEM_MD` under the same environment contract and print `{system_md, chars, sentinel_found}`.

### Scenario 7: Workspace-local SYSTEM_MD Is Not Rewritten

Purpose: avoid over-materializing normal local paths.

Setup:

```text
WORKDIR=/tmp/motoko-dst/workdir
SYSTEM_MD=/tmp/motoko-dst/workdir/SYSTEM.md
```

Expected:

- `SYSTEM_MD` remains the original path or an equivalent path under `WORKDIR`
- content is unchanged
- child read succeeds

### Scenario 8: Missing External SYSTEM_MD Fails Loudly

Purpose: avoid returning to a silent empty prompt.

Setup:

```text
WORKDIR=/tmp/motoko-dst/workdir
SYSTEM_MD=/tmp/motoko-dst/missing/SYSTEM.md
```

Expected:

- harness emits a warning or the child emits `system_prompt_built chars=0`
- DST marks this as a failure unless the test explicitly expects a missing-prompt case

The invariant should be phrased positively for production profiles: if `SYSTEM_MD` is non-empty and intended to be read, the runtime must observe non-empty prompt content.

### Where This Fits

PR #75 DST is loop-state DST. PR #76 needs harness-boundary DST. They are related because both protect the same semantic invariant:

```text
Every provider call that requires the AILANG reference must receive a non-empty, stable system prompt.
```

The end-to-end invariant spans two layers:

1. TypeScript harness materializes and forwards a sandbox-readable prompt path.
2. AILANG runtime reads the prompt, builds the system message, and pins it outside compaction.

Testing only layer 2 would not catch PR #76. Testing only layer 1 would not catch PR #75. The DST suite should include both.

## Architecture Options

### Option A: Extend Existing Stub Provider

Current file: `src/core/test/stub_step.ail`

It already provides:

- `ScriptedStep`
- `StepProvider = LiveAI | Scripted([ScriptedStep])`
- `dispatch_step`
- `run_v2_with_stub` integration path through `agent_loop_v2`

Needed addition:

- record the `msgs` passed into each scripted provider call
- expose those recorded calls to tests

Possible implementation directions:

- add a `RecordingScripted` provider variant with an explicit call log carried in the provider state
- return `{ result, next_provider, observed_msgs }` from a test-only dispatch function

Pros:

- smallest conceptual change
- captures the load-bearing provider-call payload exactly where it is consumed
- tests the real loop path
- reuses existing scripted `StepResult` constructors

Cons:

- AILANG effects and recursive provider state may make call-log threading awkward
- current package-resolution issues around `pkg/...` imports can block loop-level tests until fixed

### Option B: Extract Pre-Step Compaction Pipeline

Create a pre-provider helper in `agent_loop_v2.ail`:

```ailang
prepare_provider_messages(
  rt,
  ctx,
  msgs,
  model,
  last_input_tokens
) -> Result[[Message], string]
```

The helper would:

1. partition system messages
2. call extension `on_pre_step`
3. call `compact_step_actual`
4. re-prepend system messages

Pros:

- directly testable
- narrower than full loop
- captures the critical PR #75 behavior

Cons:

- not pure if extension hooks are included; `on_pre_step` carries a broad effect row
- production refactor required
- still needs a fake extension runtime
- does not by itself prove what was actually handed to `dispatch_step`

### Option C: Pure Compaction State Machine Mirror

Build a test-only pure model of the pre-step compaction pipeline and compare production helper outputs against it.

Pros:

- easy to generate many seeded cases
- no provider or extension effects

Cons:

- risks testing the mirror instead of production behavior
- less valuable unless paired with Option A or B

Recommendation: start with Option A. A recorder at `dispatch_step` observes the ephemeral compacted payload actually sent to the provider. Option B can follow later if a clean, useful subset can be extracted without hiding the effectful extension path.

## Seeded Simulation After Scenario Tests

After the fixed scenarios pass, add seeded generation. The generator should produce bounded message histories with controlled structure:

- 0-3 system messages
- 1-20 user messages
- 0-20 assistant messages
- 0-20 tool messages
- optional assistant tool calls with small, medium, or huge `arguments`
- tool outputs with small, elidable, and non-elidable sizes
- `actual_input` values around thresholds: `threshold - 1`, `threshold`, `threshold + 1`

Generated invariants should avoid asserting exact final prose. They should assert structural facts:

- no system message is lost
- system prefix remains byte-identical
- no `tool_call_id` is lost
- elision never increases list length
- recent tool messages remain unelided
- unknown models fail open
- repeated run with same seed returns identical call log

The seed must be printed on failure and accepted as a rerun input.

## CI Strategy

Suggested targets:

```make
test_dst_setup:
	ailang lock

test_dst_compaction:
	ailang run --caps IO --entry main scripts/smoke_v2_compaction_actual_dst.ail

test_dst: test_dst_setup test_dst_compaction
```

If `ailang lock` does not hydrate all registry packages imported by `registry_generated.ail`, add explicit `ailang install vendor/name@version` steps for the missing packages before enabling full-loop DST in CI.

Merge gate phases:

1. Pure helper checks only
2. Scenario DST with scripted provider
3. Seeded DST with 100 seeds
4. Seeded DST with 500 seeds once runtime is stable

Real-provider OpenRouter or Ollama tests should remain optional smoke tests, not the primary gate.

## Current Repo Observations

- `src/core/test/stub_step.ail` already has most of the scripted provider machinery.
- `src/core/test/integration_tests.ail` already documents some core invariants, but `test_compaction_fires_above_70pct` is stale under the new `context_limit - 75000` headroom policy.
- `scripts/smoke_v2_compaction_tiers.ail` encodes old threshold assumptions and currently needs revision for the new headroom and actual-token policy.
- `scripts/smoke_v2_compaction_full_loop.ail` is also stale because it uses `test/tiny` and old chars/4/no-headroom threshold math.
- Loop-level checks are currently blocked in this checkout unless the AILANG registry cache contains every extension package imported by `src/core/ext/registry_generated.ail`. `run_v2_with_stub` imports `agent_loop_v2`, and `agent_loop_v2` imports the generated registry, so missing packages unrelated to the active test still break full-loop smokes.
- A narrow pure smoke can still be written immediately for `compact_step_actual`, `estimate_tokens_messages`, and tool-shape preservation.


## Proposed First Implementation Slice

Create `scripts/smoke_v2_compaction_actual_dst.ail` with pure deterministic checks:

1. `actual_tokens_low_no_elision`
2. `actual_tokens_60pct_keep_last_10`
3. `actual_tokens_75pct_keep_last_5`
4. `actual_tokens_85pct_emergency`
5. `tool_call_arguments_counted`
6. `tool_shape_preserved_by_elision`

Then add the loop-level DST once provider-call recording is available:

1. `last_input_tokens_carries_forward`
2. `system_hidden_from_extension`
3. `provider_receives_system_prefix_after_compaction`

This sequence gives immediate regression value without waiting for the deeper harness refactor.

## Open Questions

- Should `partition_system_msgs` be exported or kept private and tested only through a pre-step helper?
- Should compaction policy thresholds be constants exported from `compaction.ail` to avoid tests duplicating magic numbers?
- Should the 75k output headroom be model-specific rather than global?
- Can AILANG tests carry an inspectable provider call log without `SharedMem`, or is explicit state threading better?
- Should extension compaction be allowed to summarize assistant messages with tool calls, or should those be protected like system messages?
- What is the smallest loop-level seam that lets tests inspect provider inputs without weakening production encapsulation?
