## Thesis

Motoko needs a generalized Deterministic Simulation Testing (DST) system, not one-off smokes for each bug. The recurring failures have the same shape: behavior depends on multi-step state transitions across process boundaries, environment setup, sandbox rules, provider telemetry, extension hooks, tool dispatch, and conversation history.

PR #75 and PR #76 should become two scenario families in a larger simulation framework:

- **Loop-state scenario:** provider token telemetry from one step affects compaction before the next step.
- **Harness-boundary scenario:** parent process materializes a readable system prompt before spawning the sandboxed AILANG runtime.

The generalized system should let us add these as data-driven scenarios with shared fixtures, fakes, recorders, and invariant checkers.

## What DST Means Here

DST is not "mock everything and assert a string." For Motoko, DST means:

1. Build a deterministic model of the external contracts around the agent.
2. Drive the real production transition code where possible.
3. Record all boundary observations.
4. Assert invariants over traces, not over final model prose.
5. Print a seed or scenario id that exactly reproduces any failure.

The test oracle should be structural:

- Was the system prompt non-empty and stable?
- Did provider-call messages preserve required protocol fields?
- Did the loop terminate within budget?
- Did tool calls flow through policy and handlers in the expected order?
- Did sandboxed paths become readable by the child?
- Did extension hooks receive the right slice of state?
- Did cost/context counters advance monotonically and drive the next decision?

## AILANG Docs Grounding

This draft was checked against the AILANG docs MCP configured in `.mcp.json`.

Important version note: the local repo declares `ailang = ">=0.24.2"` and the local binary reports `AILANG v0.24.2`, but the MCP docs server does not expose any `0.17.x` through `0.24.x` snapshots. It jumps from `0.16.1` to `0.25.0`, with `latest = 0.25.0`. The grounding below therefore uses MCP `latest` docs and stdlib metadata as directional evidence, not as a guaranteed local API contract. Anything used for implementation must be validated against the local `ailang check`/`ailang test` binary before landing.

Grounding points from MCP:

- AILANG has first-class unit and property tests in the docs (`test "name" = expr`, `property "name" (...) = expr`) and property tests generate random cases with shrinking.
- Property-test configuration is documented through environment variables: `ailang_test_runs`, `ailang_test_seed`, `ailang_test_max_size`, `ailang_test_min_int`, and `ailang_test_max_int`.
- AILANG's effect system is explicit and capability-based; side effects must appear in signatures and be granted at runtime through `--caps`.
- The docs explicitly call out testing benefits from explicit effects and describe mocking effects as planned, while pure function testing is current. That supports starting DST with pure policy tests and explicit fakes rather than assuming a mature effect-handler mocking layer.
- `std/fs` operations are sandboxed and respect `AILANG_FS_SANDBOX`, which directly grounds the PR #76 scenario.
- `std/env` exposes environment variables through snapshot semantics and allowlist enforcement; DST should test child-env preparation in TypeScript and not assume all parent env vars are visible inside AILANG.
- `std/rand` provides `rand_seed(seed)` and deterministic random generation via the `Rand` effect. This can support AILANG-native seeded fuzzing where the local version supports it.
- `std/clock` latest-docs metadata exposes only `now() -> int ! {Clock}` and `sleep(ms: int) -> () ! {Clock}`. Their docstrings mention virtual time in deterministic mode, but the module surface does not show how to enable that mode. DST should either normalize clock-derived fields out of traces or first identify the runtime flag/control that activates virtual time.
- `std/trace` exposes `spanStart`, `spanEnd`, and `event` with the `Trace` effect. `std/trace_test` exposes trace-existence assertions. This supports an optional trace-backed oracle, though the first DST trace recorder can simply emit normalized JSONL from the harness.
- `std/ai` defines the multi-turn protocol shape used by Motoko: `Message`, `ToolCall`, `ToolSchema`, `StepResult`, `AIError`, `step`, `stepWithCache`, and streaming variants. Its docs state that tool results come back as `role="tool"` messages whose `tool_call_id` matches a prior `ToolCall.id`, which grounds the tool-shape invariants.

## Current Preconditions

Do not add generalized DST on top of known-red foundation tests. The current compaction branch has two prerequisites:

- **Registry/package hydration:** `run_v2_with_stub` imports `agent_loop_v2`, which imports `registry_generated.ail`, which imports all extension register modules. A checkout with only a partial AILANG registry cache cannot run full-loop smokes. CI must run the package install/lock step before Layer 1 or Layer 3 DST.
- **Stale headroom tests:** `src/core/test/integration_tests.ail#test_compaction_fires_above_70pct` and `scripts/smoke_v2_compaction_full_loop.ail` still encode the old `test/tiny`/chars/4/no-headroom assumptions. With `effective = context_limit - 75000`, `test/tiny` has `effective <= 0`, so usage is 0 and compaction fails open. These tests need updating before DST results are meaningful.

The immediate order should be:

1. Hydrate AILANG package dependencies in CI/local setup.
2. Fix or retire stale compaction tests that contradict the new headroom policy.
3. Add provider-call recording to the existing stub path.
4. Add DST scenarios.

## Layers

A useful Motoko DST system has four layers. Each layer can be tested independently, and some scenarios intentionally cross layers.

### Layer 0: Pure Policy DST

Scope:

- pure helpers
- threshold policies
- message rewrites
- parsers
- estimators

Examples:

- `compact_step_actual`
- `estimate_tokens_messages`
- tool-result elision
- command parsing
- cost arithmetic

Simulator shape:

```text
input data -> pure function -> invariant checks
```

This layer is cheap and should run on every PR, but only after existing stale Layer 0 tests are made green. In particular, tests using `test/tiny` must account for the new `context_limit - 75000` headroom policy.

AILANG fit:

- Use regular `ailang test` for pure helpers when the syntax is supported locally.
- Use existing inline `tests [(...), ...]` style where it fits the current repo's code style.
- For scenario-like pure smokes that need richer reporting, `ailang run --caps IO --entry main ...` remains reasonable.

### Layer 1: Loop-State DST

Scope:

- `loop_v2` state transitions
- scripted provider responses
- scripted extension runtime
- scripted tool policy and tool handling
- captured provider-call messages

Simulator shape:

```text
initial loop state
  + provider script
  + extension script
  + tool script
  -> loop transition trace
  -> invariant checks
```

This is where PR #75 belongs.

AILANG fit:

- Because the docs describe effect mocking as planned rather than complete, the first implementation should use explicit dependency injection and scripted providers rather than depending on language-level effect handlers.
- Provider fakes should return `std/ai.StepResult`-shaped values and record `std/ai.Message` arrays.

### Layer 2: Harness-Boundary DST

Scope:

- TypeScript runtime harness
- profile/env loading
- child process env allowlist
- sandbox path materialization
- profile mirroring
- child spawn arguments

Simulator shape:

```text
parent env + temp filesystem + profile
  -> harness preparation
  -> child env/spawn record
  -> sandbox readability checks
```

This is where PR #76 belongs.

AILANG fit:

- `std/fs` sandbox behavior and `std/env` snapshot/allowlist behavior mean this layer belongs mostly in TypeScript harness tests, with a minimal child probe if needed.
- The child probe should not assume ambient env access; the harness must explicitly forward/allow the env vars under test.

### Layer 3: End-to-End Deterministic Harness DST

Scope:

- TypeScript harness starts a test child or AILANG runtime in stub mode
- no real provider
- no external network
- deterministic filesystem
- deterministic env server behavior

Simulator shape:

```text
workspace fixture
  -> RuntimeProcess/test child
  -> scripted loop
  -> JSONL event trace
  -> invariant checks
```

This layer is slower but gives confidence that Layers 1 and 2 compose.

AILANG fit:

- Use `--ai-stub` or scripted providers for deterministic AI behavior.
- Use `--caps` narrowly and deliberately. The relevant caps for Motoko loop tests are usually some subset of `AI,FS,Process,IO,Env,Net,SharedMem,Clock,Stream,Trace`.

## Core Components

### Scenario Schema

Each scenario should be a structured fixture with a stable id:

```json
{
  "id": "compaction.actual_tokens_drive_next_step",
  "layer": "loop-state",
  "seed": 0,
  "workspace": {},
  "env": {},
  "initialMessages": [],
  "providerScript": [],
  "extensionScript": [],
  "toolScript": [],
  "expectedInvariants": []
}
```

Not every field applies to every layer. The goal is consistent naming and reporting, not one universal mega-schema.

### Trace Recorder

The recorder should capture boundary observations in a normalized trace:

```text
scenario_start
harness_env_prepared
child_spawn_prepared
system_prompt_built
extension_pre_step_called
provider_call_prepared
provider_result
tool_policy_decision
tool_result_appended
loop_totals_updated
scenario_end
```

The trace is the object under test. Assertions should read from the trace.

Implementation note:

- AILANG's `std/trace` can emit `Trace` events, and `std/trace_test` can assert span existence. That is useful for AILANG-native trace assertions.
- For cross-layer Motoko DST, a normalized JSONL trace is still preferable as the portable boundary format because the TypeScript harness, AILANG runtime, and subprocess probes can all emit it.

### Invariant Library

Common invariants should be reusable functions:

- `system_prompt_non_empty`
- `system_prompt_stable`
- `system_messages_not_sent_to_pre_step`
- `provider_calls_have_system_prefix`
- `tool_call_ids_preserved`
- `message_order_preserved`
- `last_input_tokens_carried_forward`
- `actual_tokens_select_compaction_tier`
- `provider_payload_compacted_but_history_uncompacted`
- `actual_token_pressure_not_lower_than_full_history_pressure`
- `emergency_compaction_exhaustion_uses_estimate`
- `small_effective_context_fails_open`
- `sandbox_paths_readable_by_child`
- `config_env_vars_forwarded_to_child`
- `loop_terminates_within_budget`
- `no_unexpected_provider_call_after_terminal_stop`

Scenario tests should mostly compose invariants instead of implementing bespoke assertions.

For compaction specifically, remember that compaction is ephemeral: the compacted message list is sent to the provider, but the loop recurses on the full uncompacted history. The provider-call recorder is therefore the load-bearing observation point. Tests that inspect only returned or persisted `msgs` will miss the behavior that matters.

### Fakes and Scripts

Provider fake:

- returns scripted `StepResult`s
- records each input message list
- supports explicit `input_tokens`, `output_tokens`, `finish_reason`, `tool_calls`
- uses `std/ai` protocol types where possible

Extension fake:

- records hook inputs
- can return `PassThrough`
- can return `Compacted`
- can deny or delegate tools
- can maliciously try to drop messages

Tool fake:

- returns scripted stdout/stderr/exit code
- can generate large outputs
- can fail deterministically
- can simulate truncation

Harness fake child:

- records env
- validates sandbox-readable paths
- optionally emits minimal JSONL events such as `system_prompt_built`

Filesystem fixture:

- creates temp workspaces
- creates external files outside the workspace
- creates profile mirrors
- records materialized files

Random generator:

- for AILANG-native fuzzing, use `std/rand.rand_seed(seed)` plus `rand_int`, `rand_bool`, and `rand_float` where supported by the local binary
- for TypeScript harness-boundary fuzzing, use a deterministic seeded RNG in TS and persist the seed in the failure trace

## DST Plus Fuzzing

It makes sense to combine DST with fuzzing in Motoko, but the fuzzing should be structured and seed-reproducible. Plain random fuzzing over full agent runs would mostly produce noisy failures and hard-to-debug traces. The better model is:

```text
Deterministic simulator + seeded scenario generator + invariant library
```

In other words, DST supplies the controlled world and the trace oracle; fuzzing supplies many variations inside that world.

### Why The Combination Fits Motoko

Motoko has many bug-prone boundaries:

- provider message protocol shape
- tool-call and tool-result correlation
- context and cost counters across steps
- extension hook ordering
- sandbox path materialization
- environment-variable forwarding
- profile mirroring
- parser handling of model-generated text
- truncation and large tool outputs

Most of these are not well tested by either hand-written examples or black-box provider runs. Seeded fuzzing inside a deterministic harness can explore the cross-product:

```text
message history shape
  x provider token counts
  x extension hook decisions
  x tool result sizes
  x env/profile path layouts
  x termination reasons
```

The key is that every generated case must still be a valid Motoko protocol scenario, or an intentionally invalid scenario with a clearly expected failure mode.

### Fuzzing Levels

#### Level A: Pure Input Fuzzing

Applies to Layer 0.

Good targets:

- command/fence parsing
- JSON-ish tool argument parsing
- token estimation
- path normalization
- config coercion

Example generators:

- malformed markdown fences
- nested code blocks
- huge strings
- unicode and zero-width characters
- incomplete JSON
- paths with symlinks, `..`, absolute paths, spaces

Oracle:

- function is total
- output shape is valid
- round-trip properties where applicable
- no unexpected panic

#### Level B: Protocol-Shape Fuzzing

Applies to Layer 1.

Good targets:

- message sequences
- tool-call arrays
- assistant/tool correlation
- provider finish reasons
- token counters
- extension decisions

Example generators:

- 0-3 system messages
- 0-20 previous tool results
- assistant messages with 0-N tool calls
- matching and mismatching `tool_call_id`s
- provider `input_tokens` around compaction thresholds
- tool outputs just below and above elision thresholds
- extension `PassThrough` vs `Compacted`

Oracle:

- system messages are not lost
- provider-call shape remains valid
- tool IDs are preserved by compaction
- actual tokens drive compaction tiers
- loop terminates within step budget
- invalid protocol inputs fail loudly or are sanitized according to policy

#### Level C: Harness Layout Fuzzing

Applies to Layer 2.

Good targets:

- `WORKDIR`
- `SYSTEM_MD`
- `MOTOKO_CONFIG`
- `MOTOKO_REPO`
- profile directories
- sandbox-readable and sandbox-unreadable paths

Example generators:

- prompt inside workspace
- prompt outside workspace
- missing prompt
- relative prompt path
- absolute profile path
- repo path equal to workdir
- repo path different from workdir
- profile already mirrored
- basename collisions for absolute profiles

Oracle:

- child env contains required config vars
- sandbox-readable files are materialized
- external files are copied with identical content
- missing required files fail loudly
- no feature silently disappears because an env var was scrubbed

#### Level D: Stateful Sequence Fuzzing

Applies to Layers 1 and 3.

Good targets:

- multi-step loops
- repeated tool failures
- compaction after long histories
- cost cap exhaustion
- retry behavior
- terminal vs non-terminal finish reasons

Example generators:

- provider script of length 1-50
- stochastic but seeded finish reasons
- high token counts followed by low token counts
- repeated tool calls with growing outputs
- extension compaction at random steps
- tool denial at random steps

Oracle:

- no infinite loop
- budget exhaustion happens before unbounded recursion
- terminal stop prevents further provider calls
- summaries/events reflect the final termination reason
- all provider calls remain protocol-valid

### Seed Discipline

Fuzzing only belongs in DST if failures are reproducible.

Every fuzz test should report:

```text
scenario_id
seed
generator version
shrunk/minimized input if available
normalized trace
first failed invariant
```

Seeded generators should be deterministic across machines as much as possible. Avoid depending on wall time, filesystem listing order, live network, provider output, or platform-specific temp path names unless those values are explicitly normalized in the trace.

AILANG-specific seed controls:

```bash
ailang_test_runs=500 ailang_test_seed=42 ailang test path/to/test.ail
```

For scenario runners invoked with `ailang run`, pass the seed explicitly through args or env:

```bash
DST_SEED=42 ailang run --caps IO,Rand --entry main scripts/smoke_dst_loop.ail
```

If using `std/rand`, call `rand_seed(seed)` at the beginning of each generated scenario so the sequence is not affected by previous tests.

### Shrinking

Shrinking is useful but not required for v1. For Motoko, the first practical shrinker can be domain-specific:

- reduce number of messages
- reduce tool-output size
- reduce provider script length
- remove extension decisions one by one
- move token counts to the nearest threshold boundary
- simplify paths from complex absolute paths to minimal inside/outside workspace examples

This will be more useful than generic byte-level shrinking because the failures are usually protocol or state-machine failures.

### What Not To Fuzz Initially

Avoid fuzzing real providers. It will be expensive and mostly unreproducible.

Avoid fully arbitrary invalid message arrays as the main workload. They can be useful negative tests, but if most generated inputs are nonsense, the harness will spend its time testing defensive checks rather than Motoko behavior.

Avoid concurrent fuzzing until the single-threaded deterministic trace is stable. Concurrency can come later for env-server and process-lifecycle bugs.

### Recommended v1 Combination

Start with fixed scenarios for known regressions, then fuzz around their parameters:

```text
Fixed scenario:
  compaction.actual_tokens_drive_next_step

Fuzz dimensions:
  number of old tool messages
  tool output sizes
  exact token count around 60/75/85%
  assistant tool_call argument sizes
  extension PassThrough vs Compacted
```

```text
Fixed scenario:
  harness.external_system_md_materialized

Fuzz dimensions:
  SYSTEM_MD inside/outside workspace
  relative vs absolute path
  missing vs present file
  nested workspace paths
  profile mirror present vs absent
```

This gives the value of fuzzing without losing the clarity of scenario-based DST.

## Scenario Families

The policy-specific compaction research doc owns detailed fixtures for PR #75. This generalized doc should keep only the scenario taxonomy and shared invariants to avoid drift.

### PR #75: Loop-State Compaction

Canonical scenario ids:

- `compaction.actual_tokens_drive_next_step`
- `compaction.system_messages_hidden_from_compactors`
- `compaction.emergency_exhaustion_estimate_gated`
- `compaction.actual_tokens_small_context_fail_open`
- `compaction.provider_payload_vs_uncompacted_history_pressure`

Required observations:

- provider-call message payloads, not just returned/persisted loop history
- extension `on_pre_step` inputs
- `last_input_tokens` after each provider result
- tool message `tool_call_id`s before and after provider-payload compaction

Key caveats:

- Step 0 or any `last_input_tokens <= 0` path uses estimate-based `compact_step` and its 70/85/95 tiers.
- The actual-token path uses 60/75/85 tiers only when `effective = context_limit - 75000` is positive.
- Emergency exhaustion is still decided by estimate-based post-elision `usage_percent`, not directly by actual provider tokens.
- Compacted messages are sent to the provider but are not persisted as the next loop history.

### PR #76: Harness-Boundary Prompt Materialization

Canonical scenario ids:

- `harness.external_system_md_materialized`
- `harness.workspace_system_md_not_rewritten`
- `harness.missing_system_md_fails_loudly`
- `harness.system_md_forwarded_to_child_env`

Required observations:

- parent env before harness preparation
- child env prepared for the AILANG runtime
- materialized file paths and content hashes
- sandbox readability under `AILANG_FS_SANDBOX`
- `system_prompt_built` chars when a child/runtime probe is used

## Cross-Layer Scenario

### Scenario: `system_prompt_read_then_pinned_through_compaction`

Layer: End-to-end deterministic harness DST

Purpose: compose PR #76 and PR #75 invariants.

Fixture:

```text
WORKDIR outside prompt location
SYSTEM_MD external to WORKDIR
scripted provider returns high input_tokens on step 1
extension tries to compact/drop conversation before step 2
```

Invariants:

- harness materializes `SYSTEM_MD`
- runtime emits non-empty `system_prompt_built`
- extension never sees system messages
- provider calls receive non-empty system prefix
- step 2 compaction is driven by step 1 actual tokens
- system prefix is still present after compaction

This is the best high-level regression for the combined failure class: "the agent loses the AILANG reference during long runs."

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 0: Restore Test Preconditions

Before new DST work:

- run the repo's package hydration step in CI and local setup (`ailang lock` or explicit `ailang install` for registry dependencies from `ailang.toml`/`ailang.lock`)
- make full-loop smoke imports reliable by ensuring every extension referenced by `src/core/ext/registry_generated.ail` is present in the local AILANG registry cache
- update stale compaction tests that still assume no output headroom, especially `src/core/test/integration_tests.ail#test_compaction_fires_above_70pct` and `scripts/smoke_v2_compaction_full_loop.ail`
- update `src/core/compaction.ail`'s module header to document both tier policies: estimate fallback 70/85/95 and actual-token 60/75/85

### Phase 1: Make Existing Boundaries Inspectable

Add test-only or production-safe seams:

- provider-call recorder for the existing scripted `StepProvider` path in `src/core/test/stub_step.ail`
- extension hook recorder
- harness preparation function that can be invoked without launching the full UI
- child env/spawn recorder for `RuntimeProcess`

Avoid large refactors. The first goal is observability at boundaries, especially the provider-call payload consumed by `dispatch_step`. Extracting a separate "prepare provider messages" helper can wait; it would carry broad extension-hook effect rows and still would not directly observe the payload handed to the provider.

### Phase 2: Add Scenario Runners

Two runners are enough initially:

```text
scripts/dst_loop_scenarios.ail
src/tui/src/runtime-process-env.test.ts or src/tui/src/harness-dst.test.ts
```

The AILANG runner covers Layers 0-1. The TypeScript runner covers Layer 2. Layer 3 can wait until the two lower layers stabilize.

### Phase 3: Add Reusable Invariants

Start with handwritten invariant functions. Do not introduce a heavy property-testing framework yet.

Recommended first invariants:

- system prompt non-empty
- provider system prefix
- no system messages in pre-step extension input
- tool IDs preserved after compaction
- actual-token tier selection
- sandbox path readability

### Phase 4: Add Seeded Generation

Once scenario tests are stable, add seeded generators around the same invariants:

- message histories around compaction thresholds
- tool-call argument sizes
- system prompt path locations
- profile path layouts
- extension hook decisions
- tool success/failure/truncation outcomes

Every failure must print:

- scenario id
- seed
- minimized input if available
- normalized trace

## Where This Should Live

Start from existing test infrastructure:

- `src/core/test/stub_step.ail` already defines `ScriptedStep`, `StepProvider`, `dispatch_step`, `token_step`, `continuing_token_step`, `empty_rt`, and `deny_all_rt`.
- `src/core/agent_loop_v2.ail` already exposes `run_v2_with_stub`.
- `src/core/test/integration_tests.ail` already documents several stub invariants.
- `scripts/smoke_v2_*.ail` already contains the smoke-test convention for runtime scenarios.

The genuine missing seam is provider-call message recording inside or adjacent to `dispatch_step`, which currently receives `msgs` and then drops that observation when returning `{result, next_provider}`.

Start small:

```text
src/core/test/stub_step.ail
  add provider-call recording or a recording provider variant

scripts/
  smoke_v2_compaction_actual_dst.ail

src/tui/src/
  harness-dst.test.ts
  runtime-process-env.test.ts
```

Only grow into a dedicated tree once the above earns its keep:

```text
src/core/test/dst/
  scenarios.ail
  provider_recorder.ail
  extension_recorder.ail
  invariants.ail
  generators.ail

scripts/
  smoke_dst_loop.ail
```

If AILANG package-resolution remains unstable for full-loop tests, start with:

- pure compaction DST in `scripts/smoke_v2_compaction_actual_dst.ail`
- TypeScript harness-boundary DST in `src/tui/src/harness-dst.test.ts`

Then connect the full loop once `pkg/...` import resolution is reliable.

## CI Shape

Fast PR gate:

```bash
ailang lock
make test_core
ailang run --caps IO --entry main scripts/smoke_v2_compaction_actual_dst.ail
cd src/tui && bun test src/harness-dst.test.ts
```

If `ailang lock` does not hydrate the local registry cache for every dependency in `ailang.toml`, CI must explicitly install the missing registry packages before any full-loop DST or smoke that imports `registry_generated.ail`.

Expanded PR gate:

```bash
ailang lock
make test_dst
```

Nightly:

```bash
DST_SEEDS=500 make test_dst_seeded
```

AILANG property-test variant:

```bash
ailang_test_runs=500 ailang_test_seed=42 ailang test src/core/test/dst
```

Optional provider smoke:

```bash
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=... PROFILE=openrouter make run TASK='...'
```

The provider smoke should not be the primary regression gate.

## Design Rules

- Prefer invariant assertions over final-output assertions.
- Prefer scenario ids over vague test names.
- Keep fakes protocol-shaped, not model-shaped.
- Record boundary traces before asserting.
- Make all generated tests seed-reproducible.
- Test both "inside sandbox" and "outside sandbox" path cases.
- Treat empty system prompt as a failing invariant unless a scenario explicitly opts out.
- Keep real-provider tests optional.

## Open Questions

- Should scenario fixtures be JSON files, AILANG records, TypeScript objects, or all three by layer?
- Should `RuntimeProcess` expose a dry-run spawn-preparation API for harness DST?
- Should system prompt materialization become a standalone exported function instead of living inside `main()`?
- Should compaction thresholds and headroom be exported constants so tests do not duplicate policy values?
- Should event traces become the canonical DST output format across both AILANG and TypeScript layers?
- Can the existing `run_v2_with_stub` path be extended to record provider-call messages without invasive changes?
- Which AILANG testing syntax is safest for this repo's pinned local version: top-level `property` tests from the latest docs, or the existing inline `tests [(...)]` style already used in `src/core/*.ail`?
- Should AILANG-native DST use `std/trace`/`std/trace_test`, normalized JSONL, or both?
