# Plan 3 · Checkpoint trigger (wire `TakeCheckpoint` emission)

Authored 2026-07-08 in a fresh session grounded at HEAD `4371de0`, per
`.agent/meta-decisions/author-each-artifact-in-the-session-whose-assets-it-consumes.md`. Inputs:
`HANDOFF-write-checkpoint-trigger-plan.md`, `NOTE-remaining-dst-work-scope-and-sequence.md` (Plan 3),
ADR-001 D7, ADR-002 §2. Every `file:line` below was re-grounded at HEAD before use
(`re-ground-inherited-anchors-before-building.md`); `session.ail` line numbers drift by the dozen —
re-verify at implementation time.

## TL;DR

The checkpoint **machinery** shipped in Phases A–C and is wired into the live loop
(`session.ail` `TakeCheckpoint(plan) => apply_checkpoint(...)`, currently `:1347`). The **trigger** is
missing: `decide` (`step_machine.ail:78`) has no `TakeCheckpoint` arm, so a long session dies at the
seal gate (`SealExhausted`, 95%) instead of taking the designed, audited escape. This plan wires the
emission under a policy gate, keeping v1 **pure, structural, independent of ABI/Plan 2, and
off-by-default**:

- **Trigger (D3-1):** pure usage-percent ceiling `checkpoint_pct = 90`, sitting between the compaction
  hard tier (85) and seal exhaustion (95). The gate fires when `history` usage `>= checkpoint_pct`.
- **Emission site + summary (D3-2/D3-3):** the effect-free decision path — specifically **inside
  `call_model_or_fail`** (the fan-in of the five model-call branches of `decide`), *not* a `decide`
  `else` arm (which would skip the `tools_complete` growth path). Structural summary, no effect.
  AI/telemetry delegation recorded as the v2 path.
- **Flag default (D3-4):** `checkpoint_enabled = false`. The never-emit tripwire is retargeted in **both**
  places that assert it — the scenario `checkpoint_never_emitted_in_v1` → `…_when_policy_off` and the
  in-module test `test_v1_policy_never_returns_take_checkpoint` → `test_default_policy_…`; positive twins
  added for each. v1-never-emits becomes v1-never-emits-**by-default** (the D9/D-B5 amendment pattern).
- **Termination guard (D3-5):** pressure-cleared (checkpoint rebuilds history to `pinned ++ [summary]`,
  dropping usage far below threshold) **plus a pure "would-relieve" precondition** — the gate emits
  only if the projected post-checkpoint usage falls below `checkpoint_pct`. This handles the degenerate
  case (system prefix alone `>=` threshold) found by verification (§0), where a naive guard spins
  forever.

Blast radius: two new `StepPolicy` fields, one gate in `call_model_or_fail`, one pure summary builder +
two pure helpers in `phase_vocab`; scenario edits (retarget 1, add 2) and in-module test edits (rename 1,
add 1); and validating checkpoint output via the shared `validate_compactor_output` law **on its
non-system segment** while keeping `history_valid_transcript` on the full history. No ABI change, no kit
change, no checkpoint-mechanics change.

## 0. Grounding note (what re-grounding at HEAD `4371de0` confirmed / corrected)

Confirmed:

- `decide(s: StepState, pol: StepPolicy) -> StepDecision` (`step_machine.ail:78`) is effect-free (a plain
  `func` with no effect row, not `pure`-annotated) and has **no `TakeCheckpoint` arm** (arms:
  RunTools/await/inject/Finalize via `call_model_or_fail`). It receives `s.history`, `s.telemetry`, and
  `pol.compaction.context_limit` — everything a structural trigger needs, no effect. `pure func`s in
  `phase_vocab` (e.g. `test_checkpoint_*` at `:880`) already call `checkpoint`, so the new `pure`
  helpers (§4.3) may call it too.
- `mk_policy(context_limit)` (`step_machine.ail:109`) builds the `StepPolicy`; `pol.compaction` is a
  `CompactionPolicy` with `context_limit`, `elide_tier_pct: 70`, `elide_hard_tier_pct: 85`,
  `emergency_pct: 95` (`phase_vocab.ail:163`).
- `checkpoint(h, plan) -> {history, event}` (`phase_vocab.ail:239`) rebuilds history to
  `take_system_prefix(xs) ++ [summary_msg]` where `summary_msg.content = "[CHECKPOINT] ${plan.summary}"`
  (`:243-246`). `apply_checkpoint` (`:323`) is the atomic driver path. `CheckpointPlan = {reason, summary}`
  (`:237`). `TakeCheckpoint(CheckpointPlan)` is a `StepDecision` variant (`:367`).
- The live handler is already wired: `TakeCheckpoint(plan) => let cp = apply_checkpoint(step_state, plan);
  ledger_emit(...); c2_loop(... next_state)` (`session.ail:1347-1369`). **Emission is the only missing
  piece; handling exists.**
- `seal_compacted_payload` (`phase_vocab.ail:140`) is the single effectful send-gate; `project` (`:176`)
  is pure and its payload/events are discarded by the live loop (ADR-002 §2 findings 1–2). This is the
  project-vs-seal fork D3-2 turns on.
- Usage math: `usage_percent_with_limit(msgs, limit)` and `exhaustion_pct() = 95` in `compaction.ail:25,30`;
  ~4 chars/token.
- Suite registers **13 scenarios** (`phase_c_l1_scenarios.ail:435-447`, prints `PASS count=13`). The
  checkpoint scenarios: `history_rewrite_requires_checkpoint_event` (`:137`),
  `checkpoint_output_is_valid_transcript` (`:172`), `checkpoint_never_emitted_in_v1` (`:298`).
- The shared valid-transcript law `validate_compactor_output` lives in
  `packages/motoko_ext_conformance/invariants.ail:133` and is imported by core at
  `src/core/ext/runtime.ail:27` and by the scenario file at `scripts/phase_c_l1_scenarios.ail:35`.

Corrected / newly discovered (see §1 gaps):

- **The handoff's `:1293` handler anchor is now `:1347`** (drift, as warned).
- **`checkpoint_output_is_valid_transcript` uses `history_valid_transcript`, not the shared law — and
  the two check *complementary* things, not the same thing twice.** `history_valid_transcript(cp.history)`
  (`:183`) validates the **full** history (system head-prefix present, pairing well-formed).
  `invariants.validate_compactor_output(input, output)` validates a **non-system segment
  transformation** — and it **rejects any system message in `output`** (`invariants.ail:70`,
  `no_system_in_output` `:89`). The live call site confirms this: `runtime.ail:170` feeds it the
  *compacted segment* `(msgs, compacted_msgs)`, never the pinned system prefix. **Therefore the shared
  law cannot be applied to the whole checkpoint history** (which keeps the system prefix) — it must be
  applied to the checkpoint's **segment** rewrite (input = original non-system tail, output = the
  `[summary]` message). `history_valid_transcript` stays for the system-prefix-preservation half. See G1
  (corrected) and §5.4.
- **The pressure-cleared guard is insufficient alone.** Verified with a minimal repro
  (`scratchpad/verify_guard.ail`, `ailang run --caps IO`):

  | case | before | after checkpoint | history len |
  |------|--------|------------------|-------------|
  | normal (small system prefix) | 91% | **16%** | 6 → 2 |
  | large system prefix (~25% of limit) | 105% | **31%** | 6 → 2 |
  | **system prefix alone ≥ 90% of limit** | 171% | **96%** | 6 → 2 |

  In the third case the checkpoint keeps the full system prefix, so post-checkpoint usage stays ≥
  threshold and a naive `decide` would re-emit `TakeCheckpoint` every step forever. D3-5's guard must
  therefore include the "would-relieve" precondition (§2, §4.3). This is evidence, not assertion.
- **The model-call decision fans in through `call_model_or_fail`, not a single `else`.** `decide`
  (`step_machine.ail:78`) routes **five** finish-reason branches to `call_model_or_fail`
  (`stream_error`, `intercept_handled`, `tools_complete`, `user_injected`, and the final `else`).
  `tools_complete` — the branch after a tool batch finishes — is the *dominant* history-growth path.
  So the trigger must be gated **inside `call_model_or_fail`** (`:67`), after its budget/cost `Fail`
  checks and before `project`/`CallModel`; an arm in `decide`'s final `else` alone would never fire
  after a tool batch. (Earlier drafts of §4.2 placed it in the `else` — corrected.)
- **The never-emit invariant is asserted in TWO places, not one.** Besides the scenario, there is an
  in-module test `test_v1_policy_never_returns_take_checkpoint` (`step_machine.ail:347`). Both must be
  retargeted to "…by default"; §4.1/§5 enumerate both.

## 1. ADR gaps found (record, don't invent silently)

- **G1 — "the same gate" for checkpoint output is under-specified, because checkpoint output and
  compactor output are different shapes.** ADR-001 D7(e) (`:223-225`) says checkpoint output is validated
  "by the same gate" as ext compaction. But `validate_compactor_output` operates on a *non-system
  segment* and **rejects system messages** (`invariants.ail:70`), whereas a checkpoint history *keeps*
  the pinned system prefix. So "the same gate" cannot mean "feed the whole checkpoint history to the same
  predicate" — that would fail. **Resolution (this plan):** apply the shared law to the checkpoint's
  **segment** rewrite (the obligations it actually owns: no invented/severed tool ids, no system message
  in the summarized tail), and keep `history_valid_transcript(cp.history)` for the full-history
  system-prefix-preservation obligation. Amend D7(e) to say checkpoint output satisfies
  `validate_compactor_output` **on its non-system segment** and `history_valid_transcript` **on the full
  history** — the union is "the same obligations as ext compaction," expressed over the two shapes.
- **G2 — D7 under-specifies the helper surface `decide` needs.** `decide` lives in `step_machine.ail`
  and cannot destructure the opaque `History` type (not exported from `phase_vocab`). To compute the
  trigger and the would-relieve precondition purely, `phase_vocab` must export two small pure helpers
  (`history_usage_percent`, `checkpoint_would_relieve`, §4.3). D7 names neither. **Resolution:** add them
  in `phase_vocab` (the module that owns `History` internals) and note them in the D7 amendment.
- **G3 — the degenerate no-escape case is unspecified.** Neither ADR-001 D7 nor ADR-002 says what happens
  when no checkpoint can relieve pressure (system prefix alone ≥ threshold, §0). **Resolution:** `decide`
  does **not** emit in that case; it falls through to `CallModel` → `seal`, which returns `SealExhausted`
  — the honest terminal state (a run whose *pinned* prompt exceeds the window cannot be rescued by
  rewriting the tail). Record this in the D7 amendment as the trigger's precondition.
- **G4 — trigger uses the model-window limit, not the seal's pinned-adjusted limit.** The live seal path
  subtracts `pinned_tokens` from `context_limit` for the ext chain (`session.ail:1450-1451`); `decide`'s
  structural trigger uses `pol.compaction.context_limit` over the full history. This is an intentional
  simplification for v1 (the trigger is a *coarse* ceiling, not the exact seal predicate). Note as a
  fidelity caveat, not a defect.
- **G5 — implementation HEAD no longer threads checkpointed history in the live handler.** This plan's
  §4.4 claimed the `TakeCheckpoint` handler already threads `cp.state` into `next_state`; at
  implementation HEAD `b74fc4f`, `session.ail:1352` still sets `msgs: st.msgs` after
  `apply_checkpoint(step_state, plan)`. That preserves the old history in the live loop even though the
  checkpoint event is emitted. This is a contract drift from the plan, not a line-number drift.
  **Resolution on landing:** add read-only `history_messages(History) -> [Message]` and thread
  `msgs: history_messages(cp.state.history)` in the existing handler so the audited rewrite is the next
  loop state.

## 2. Decisions closed (operator sign-off 2026-07-08 — carry the amendments, do not re-litigate)

Recommendations presented with tradeoffs; operator approved the bundle below.

- **D3-1 · Trigger condition — usage-% ceiling above the compaction ladder.** A `checkpoint_pct` field
  in `StepPolicy` (default **90**), between hard-tier (85) and exhaustion (95). Predicate:
  `history_usage_percent(s.history, pol.compaction.context_limit) >= pol.checkpoint_pct`. Rationale:
  checkpoint is the escape *after* compaction can no longer recover headroom but *before* seal kills the
  run. Rejected: "reactive to seal exhaustion" (requires the effectful site, contradicts D3-2);
  "step-budget proximity" (decoupled from the token-ceiling rationale).
- **D3-2 · Emission site — the effect-free decision path** (specifically inside `call_model_or_fail`, §0/§4.2). The
  trigger and summary are pure functions of `StepState`; no effect is needed, so emission stays on the
  effect-free decision path (`decide`/`call_model_or_fail` carry no effect row), keeping Plan 3
  independent of ABI/Plan 2. Rejected for v1: the effectful seal site (needed only if the summary
  requires AI/telemetry — the v2 path).
- **D3-3 · Summary source — structural.** The `CheckpointPlan.summary` is built purely from `StepState`:
  step index, message/tool-call counts elided, and the pre-checkpoint digest. No AI, no ABI telemetry.
  AI-summary delegation via a compactor extension is recorded as the documented **v2** option. Checkpoint
  output must satisfy the D7(e) obligations regardless — `validate_compactor_output` on its non-system
  segment **and** `history_valid_transcript` on the full history (G1). Note: for the trivial structural
  summary the segment check passes near-vacuously (the summary is a single assistant message with no tool
  structure); it becomes load-bearing under the v2 summary that may retain tool-bearing tail messages,
  and it satisfies the "one law, no second copy" directive today.
- **D3-4 · Policy flag default — OFF.** `checkpoint_enabled = false` in the shipped default (`mk_policy`).
  `checkpoint_never_emitted_in_v1` is **retargeted** to `checkpoint_never_emitted_when_policy_off` (still
  true for the default), and a **new** `checkpoint_emitted_under_pressure` scenario asserts emission with
  the flag on. Rejected: default ON (changes every session's behavior, deletes the tripwire outright).
- **D3-5 · Termination guard — pressure-cleared + would-relieve precondition.** Primary: checkpoint
  rebuilds history to `pinned ++ [summary]`, so usage drops below `checkpoint_pct` and the next `decide`
  falls through to `CallModel` (progress). Precondition (required by the §0 boundary finding): `decide`
  emits only if `checkpoint_would_relieve(s.history, plan, limit, pol.checkpoint_pct)` is true; otherwise
  it does not checkpoint and lets the loop reach seal-exhaustion honestly. This stays **pure** — no new
  `StepState` field, no latch plumbing (the latch option was rejected as strictly heavier and the
  would-relieve predicate subsumes it).

**ADR-001 D7 amendment text (apply on landing, `:226-228`):**

> v1 policy emits `TakeCheckpoint` **only when the checkpoint policy is enabled** (`checkpoint_enabled`,
> default off) **and** structural context usage over `History` reaches `checkpoint_pct` (default 90,
> between the hard-elide tier and exhaustion) **and** the rebuilt history would bring usage below that
> ceiling (`checkpoint_would_relieve`); if the pinned system prefix alone exceeds the ceiling, no
> checkpoint is emitted and the loop reaches seal-exhaustion, the honest terminal state. The trigger and
> summary are pure functions of `StepState` (structural summary; AI-delegated summary is a v2 option).
> Checkpoint output satisfies the same transcript obligations as ext-compaction output, expressed over
> its two shapes: the shared `motoko_ext_conformance/invariants.validate_compactor_output` law on its
> **non-system segment**, and `history_valid_transcript` on the **full history** (the system prefix is
> preserved, not passed to the segment law, which rejects system messages) — both under
> `checkpoint_output_is_valid_transcript`. The former "v1 never emits" invariant becomes **"v1 never emits
> by default"**, enforced by `checkpoint_never_emitted_when_policy_off` (scenario) and the renamed
> `test_default_policy_never_returns_take_checkpoint` (in-module test), plus the positive
> `checkpoint_emitted_under_pressure` scenario.

## 4. Implementation

### 4.1 `StepPolicy` — two new fields (`phase_vocab.ail:270`)

```
export type StepPolicy = {
  ...existing...
  compaction: CompactionPolicy,
  checkpoint_enabled: bool,   -- [NEW] gates emission; default false
  checkpoint_pct: int         -- [NEW] usage ceiling that triggers checkpoint; default 90
}
```

**Blast radius (structural records — every literal must gain both fields):** `mk_policy`
(`step_machine.ail:109`, set `false`/`90`), the two inline policies in `step_machine` tests
(`~:210,:222`), the scenario `policy()` helper (`phase_c_l1_scenarios.ail:100`), and every other
`StepPolicy` constructor. Grep to enumerate at implementation time:
`grep -rn "step_budget:" src scripts --include=*.ail | grep -v .ailang/cache` (8 files at HEAD:
`agent_loop_v2`, `phase_vocab`, `session`, `recovery`, `step_machine`, `test/scripted_ports`,
`phase_c_l1_scenarios`, `phase_f_pipeline_wiring`). Prefer routing through `mk_policy` where a site
already does; add the two literals where it constructs inline.

### 4.2 The `TakeCheckpoint` gate — inside `call_model_or_fail` (`step_machine.ail:67`)

**Not** an arm in `decide`'s `else` chain. `decide` (`:78`) sends five finish-reason branches
(`stream_error`, `intercept_handled`, `tools_complete`, `user_injected`, final `else`) to
`call_model_or_fail`; `tools_complete` is the dominant growth path. Putting the gate in `decide`'s final
`else` would skip it after every tool batch (§0). The gate belongs in `call_model_or_fail`, **after** the
budget/cost `Fail` checks (so an over-budget run fails rather than checkpoints — correct priority) and
**before** `project`/`CallModel`:

```
func call_model_or_fail(s: StepState, pol: StepPolicy) -> StepDecision {
  if pol.step_budget > 0 && s.step_idx >= pol.step_budget
  then Fail({ ... "step budget exhausted" ... })
  else if pol.max_cost_millicents > 0 && pol.cost_metered && s.totals.cost_millicents >= pol.max_cost_millicents
  then Fail({ ... cost cap ... })
  else if should_checkpoint(s, pol)                       -- [NEW]
  then TakeCheckpoint(mk_checkpoint_plan(s))              -- [NEW]
  else match project(s.history, s.telemetry, pol.compaction) {
    Err(reason) => Fail({ code: "ContextExhausted", ... }),
    Ok(_) => CallModel({ model: pol.model })
  }
}
```

where (effect-free helpers):

```
func should_checkpoint(s: StepState, pol: StepPolicy) -> bool {
  let limit = pol.compaction.context_limit;
  pol.checkpoint_enabled
    && history_usage_percent(s.history, limit) >= pol.checkpoint_pct
    && checkpoint_would_relieve(s.history, mk_checkpoint_plan(s), limit, pol.checkpoint_pct)
}

func mk_checkpoint_plan(s: StepState) -> CheckpointPlan {
  { reason: "context_pressure_at_step_${show(s.step_idx)}",
    summary: checkpoint_summary(s) }     -- structural, see 4.3
}
```

(`should_checkpoint` and the gate each call `mk_checkpoint_plan(s)`; it is pure, so the duplicate is
free — hoist to a `let` if preferred.)

Why this also gives the termination guard: after a checkpoint the loop re-enters with the rebuilt (small)
history; `history_usage_percent` is now well below `checkpoint_pct`, so `should_checkpoint` is false and
`call_model_or_fail` proceeds to `CallModel` — progress, not another checkpoint. The `checkpoint_would_relieve`
conjunct additionally blocks the degenerate spin (§0 boundary): if the pinned prefix alone is over the
ceiling, `should_checkpoint` is false and the run falls to `project`/`CallModel`→ seal-exhaustion instead
of looping.

### 4.3 New pure helpers in `phase_vocab` (owns `History` internals)

```
-- Structural usage of a History against a model window (0 = unknown limit).
export pure func history_usage_percent(h: History, limit: int) -> int {
  match h { MkHistory(xs) => usage_percent_with_limit(xs, limit) }
}

-- Would a checkpoint bring usage below `threshold`? False when the pinned system
-- prefix alone (kept by every checkpoint) already meets/exceeds the threshold —
-- the degenerate no-escape case (G3): emitting would spin. Pure; projects the
-- exact rebuilt history via the frozen `checkpoint` op.
export pure func checkpoint_would_relieve(h: History, plan: CheckpointPlan, limit: int, threshold: int) -> bool {
  let projected = checkpoint(h, plan).history;
  history_usage_percent(projected, limit) < threshold
}
```

`checkpoint_summary(s: StepState) -> string` (home: `step_machine.ail`, or `phase_vocab` if it needs
`History` destructure — prefer `step_machine` using `history_len`) — a pure structural summary, e.g.
`"session checkpoint at step ${show(s.step_idx)}: folded ${show(history_len(s.history))} messages"`.
No AI, no telemetry effect. The exact string is not load-bearing; only that it is deterministic and that
the resulting `[CHECKPOINT] ...` assistant message keeps the output valid: it satisfies
`history_valid_transcript` on the full history (system prefix intact) and, as the sole non-system
segment message, satisfies `validate_compactor_output` (no system, no tool ids — §5.4).

### 4.4 Handler — no change

`session.ail:1347` already applies `apply_checkpoint`, emits the `CheckpointTaken` event, and continues
the loop. Confirm at implementation time it still threads `cp.state` (history rewrite) into `next_state`
(it does at HEAD: `:1354-1355` + `trace` append `:1367`). If `decide` starts emitting, this path lights up
unchanged.

## 5. Scenario changes (all core-DST class: `--caps IO`, no hydration)

1. **Retarget `checkpoint_never_emitted_in_v1` → `checkpoint_never_emitted_when_policy_off`**
   (`phase_c_l1_scenarios.ail:298`). Rename the scenario id and its registrar (`:412`, `:442`).
   **Critical:** the current fixture uses `policy(0)` + a two-message seed → `context_limit = 0` →
   `history_usage_percent = 0`, which never triggers *regardless of the flag*. Retargeting to "policy
   off" requires making the fixture **pressured** (a limit and history that put usage `≥ checkpoint_pct`,
   as in §5.2) with `checkpoint_enabled = false`; otherwise the test passes vacuously and no longer guards
   the flag. Assert `decide` does **not** return `TakeCheckpoint`.
2. **New `checkpoint_emitted_under_pressure`.** Build a state whose history usage `>= checkpoint_pct`
   with `checkpoint_enabled = true` and a system prefix well below threshold; assert `decide` returns
   `TakeCheckpoint(_)`. (Mirror the pressured fixture from `scratchpad/verify_guard.ail`: small system
   prefix + large tail, limit chosen so usage ≥ 90%.)
3. **New `checkpoint_terminates_not_spins`** (D3-5). Two parts, both observed through `decide`'s return
   (the gate is internal to `call_model_or_fail`): (a) after `apply_checkpoint` on a pressured state,
   `decide` on the *rebuilt* state returns `CallModel` (progress), not `TakeCheckpoint`; (b) the
   degenerate case — a state whose **system prefix alone** ≥ `checkpoint_pct` with the flag **on** — makes
   `decide` return `CallModel` (would-relieve is false, so no emission), not `TakeCheckpoint`, so the loop
   reaches seal-exhaustion rather than spinning. Mirror the boundary fixture from §0. Assert both.
4. **Add the shared law over the checkpoint *segment*** in `checkpoint_output_is_valid_transcript`
   (`:172`, G1). Do **not** feed the whole `cp.history` to `validate_compactor_output` — it rejects the
   pinned system messages. Instead:
   - **Keep** `history_valid_transcript(cp.history)` (system-prefix-preservation on the full history) and
     the digest-chain + `history_len == 2` checks.
   - **Add** `result_ok(validate_compactor_output(in_seg, out_seg))`, where `in_seg` / `out_seg` are the
     **non-system segments** of the pre- and post-checkpoint histories, obtained via
     `segment_messages(split_for_compaction(msgs))` (or `project(...).split.segment`). `out_seg` is the
     `[summary]` message. `Msg` and `Message` are the same record shape (`{role, content, tool_calls,
     tool_call_id}`, `types.ail:16`); the sibling `ext_compaction_invalid_rejected` scenario already
     passes such records to the law, so no conversion is needed (use `messages_to_msgs` only if the
     checker distinguishes them nominally).
5. **Rename the in-module test** `test_v1_policy_never_returns_take_checkpoint`
   (`step_machine.ail:347`) → `test_default_policy_never_returns_take_checkpoint`, and add a positive twin
   `test_enabled_policy_checkpoints_under_pressure` asserting `decide` returns `TakeCheckpoint` for an
   enabled policy + pressured state. (These run inside `make check_core` via the module's `tests`
   attributes, not the scenario suite.) Same vacuity caveat as §5.1: the current test uses `mk_policy(0)`
   + `mk_state(…, 0)` (`limit 0`, usage 0); both the renamed negative and the new positive must use a
   pressured `mk_state`/`mk_policy(limit>0)` so usage `≥ checkpoint_pct`, or the negative passes for the
   wrong reason and the positive can't fire.

Registry (`:435-447`): retarget scenario #1, append the two new scenarios → **`PASS count=15`**. In-module
tests (#5) are counted by `make check_core`, not the suite's `count=`.

## 6. Gate / acceptance criteria (checkable commands)

```bash
# 1. static + effect check of the core
ailang check src/core/step_machine.ail src/core/phase_vocab.ail

# 2. the L1 scenario suite — reconciled + new scenarios, all pure (IO only)
ailang run --caps IO --entry main scripts/phase_c_l1_scenarios.ail
#   expect final line: phase_c_l1_scenarios PASS count=15
#   (13 → 15: +checkpoint_emitted_under_pressure, +checkpoint_terminates_not_spins;
#    checkpoint_never_emitted_in_v1 renamed, not removed)

# 3. full core gate
make check_core

# 4. ADR-001 D7 amendment applied (§2 text at :226-228)
grep -n "never emits by default\|checkpoint_enabled" \
  .agent/projects/004_phase_core_refactor/ADR-001-phase-oriented-core.md
```

Done = all four green + the D7 amendment committed.

## 7. Work items (sequence)

1. **WI-1 · Policy fields.** Add `checkpoint_enabled`/`checkpoint_pct` to `StepPolicy`; update every
   constructor (grep, §4.1); `mk_policy` defaults `false`/`90`. Gate: `make check_core` compiles.
2. **WI-2 · Pure helpers.** Add `history_usage_percent`, `checkpoint_would_relieve` to `phase_vocab`;
   add `checkpoint_summary` (structural). Gate: `ailang check`.
3. **WI-3 · Trigger gate.** Add `should_checkpoint`/`mk_checkpoint_plan` and wire the gate **inside
   `call_model_or_fail`** after the budget/cost `Fail` checks (§4.2 — not a `decide` `else` arm). Gate:
   `ailang check`; existing `decide` tests still green (default off).
4. **WI-4 · Scenarios + in-module tests.** Retarget scenario #1; add the two positive scenarios; route the
   checkpoint *segment* through the output law while keeping `history_valid_transcript` (§5.4); rename the
   in-module test and add its positive twin (§5.5). Gate: `phase_c_l1_scenarios PASS count=15` **and**
   `make check_core`.
5. **WI-5 · ADR-001 D7 amendment** (§2 text) + note the new helper surface (G2) and the no-escape
   terminal (G3). Gate: grep in §6 step 4.
6. **WI-6 · Full gate.** `make check_core` green. (Optional: a live smoke — a session with
   `checkpoint_enabled=true` and a tiny `context_limit` — to observe a `history_checkpoint` ledger event,
   if a driver-level fixture is cheap; not required for acceptance.)

## 8. Out of scope (owned elsewhere / frozen — do not widen)

- Checkpoint **mechanics**: `checkpoint`, `apply_checkpoint`, digest-chain, resume validation (D7 frozen,
  built, tested). This plan only adds *read-only* pure helpers over `History`; it does not change the
  rewrite op.
- Any **ABI** change (Plan 2, frozen) or **conformance-kit** change (Plan 1, shipped). Checkpoint output
  **reuses** `invariants.validate_compactor_output`; it does not extend the law.
- **AI/telemetry-delegated summary** (v2), **resume/session-restore UX**, **multi-checkpoint compaction
  policy**. v1 is a single structural-summary escape.
- The **effectful-seal emission site** — rejected for v1 (D3-2); documented as the v2 shape only.

## 9. Risks / notes

- **Structural-record blast radius (WI-1).** Adding two `StepPolicy` fields breaks every literal that
  doesn't include them; AILANG will flag each at compile. Enumerate with the grep in §4.1 — miss one and
  `make check_core` fails loudly (acceptable: the compiler is the backstop).
- **Guard correctness rests on the would-relieve precondition, verified (§0).** Do not drop it for
  "simplicity" — the naive pressure-cleared guard spins in the system-prefix-heavy case. The
  `checkpoint_terminates_not_spins` scenario is the regression lock.
- **`step_budget` is NOT a backstop against a checkpoint spin.** The handler keeps `step_idx: st.step_idx`
  (`session.ail:1352`) — a checkpoint does not advance the step counter, so a mis-guarded checkpoint loop
  would never hit `step_budget` and would hang, not fail. `checkpoint_would_relieve` is therefore the
  *sole* termination guarantee, not merely an optimization. (This is also why the gate sits *after* the
  budget/cost `Fail` checks but is itself budget-independent.)
- **One law, still.** Checkpoint output validation goes through
  `motoko_ext_conformance/invariants.validate_compactor_output` (WI-4, G1). If a second validator appears,
  stop — that is the drift Plan 1 existed to prevent.
- **Trigger fidelity (G4).** The trigger's structural usage over the full model window is coarser than the
  seal's pinned-adjusted predicate. Acceptable for a v1 ceiling; if a future version wants exactness, that
  is the effectful-seal path (v2), not a patch here.
- **`session.ail` line drift.** The handler anchor moved `:1293 → :1347` between scope-note authoring and
  now. Re-ground it (and every anchor in §3) at implementation-time HEAD before editing.
