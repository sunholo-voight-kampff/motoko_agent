# ADR-001: Deterministic Simulation Testing Architecture for Motoko

Date: 2026-06-27
Status: Proposed
As-built: the implemented DST framework is documented in `design_docs/implemented/motoko_agent/m-motoko-dst-framework.md`

## Context

Motoko failures increasingly occur across boundaries rather than inside single pure functions. Recent compaction and harness regressions showed the same pattern:

- provider telemetry from one step influences the next loop decision
- compaction is applied to the provider-call payload but not persisted to loop history
- extension hooks can observe or rewrite the wrong slice of conversation state
- child process sandboxing can make configured files unreadable
- environment forwarding can silently disable runtime behavior

Real-provider tests are insufficient as the primary regression mechanism. They are expensive, slow, model-dependent, network-dependent, and difficult to reproduce. Unit tests are also insufficient when correctness depends on multi-step state transitions and process-boundary setup.

We need a deterministic test system that drives production transition code where practical, records boundary traces, and asserts structural invariants rather than final model prose.

The AILANG docs used for this ADR come from the MCP configured in `.mcp.json`. The local repo targets AILANG `>=0.24.2`, and the local binary observed during research was `v0.24.2`; the MCP docs expose `latest = 0.25.0` but no `0.24.x` snapshot. Therefore AILANG test syntax, stdlib helpers, and any property-test APIs are design inputs only until validated with the local `ailang check` or `ailang test`.

This ADR is based on:

- `.agent/research/DST/motoko-dst-generalized-system.md`
- `.agent/research/DST/deterministic-simulation-testing-for-agent-loop-compaction.md`
- `.agent/plans/DST_v1_Motoko_Core.md`

## Decision

Build Motoko DST as a layered scenario-and-invariant system.

DST will mean:

1. Deterministically model external contracts around Motoko.
2. Drive real production transition code where feasible.
3. Record boundary observations into normalized traces.
4. Assert reusable structural invariants over those traces.
5. Report scenario id, seed, and trace on failure.

The system will use explicit scripted fakes and recorders rather than assuming mature AILANG effect-handler mocking. AILANG latest docs describe effect mocking as planned, while the local repo currently uses explicit stubs such as `run_v2_with_stub`.

## Decision Drivers

- Deterministic replay must work without Ollama, OpenRouter, or live network.
- Tests must observe boundary payloads, not infer correctness from final model prose.
- The first implementation should use existing Motoko test seams before introducing a new framework tree.
- CI must not hide failures behind missing AILANG package-cache state.
- Seeded generation should extend fixed scenario tests, not replace them.
- Time, random, filesystem, and env observations must be normalized or explicitly controlled.

## Constraints

- Layer 1 and Layer 3 tests that import `agent_loop_v2` also import `src/core/ext/registry_generated.ail`; dependency hydration is a hard precondition, not a best-effort setup step.
- `ailang lock` is not accepted as sufficient by itself unless a follow-up check proves all generated-registry imports resolve.
- AILANG `std/clock` latest-doc metadata does not show how to enable virtual time. DST traces must normalize clock-derived fields until a local deterministic clock control is identified.
- Real-provider and live-network calls are outside the DST oracle and remain supplemental smokes only.

## Relationship To Z3 Contracts

Z3 contracts and DST are complementary, not competing, properties.

The Z3 contracts design in `design_docs/planned/m-motoko-z3-contracts.md` targets pure AILANG functions with `requires` and `ensures` clauses, then proves those clauses with `ailang verify`. That is strongest for local universal properties such as non-negative token estimates, bounded truncation, context-limit bounds, and length or id preservation in pure transformations.

DST targets properties that require execution traces across time or process boundaries. Examples include provider token telemetry from step N influencing compaction before step N+1, compacted provider payloads not being persisted back to loop history, extension hooks not seeing system messages, and `SYSTEM_MD` files remaining readable inside `AILANG_FS_SANDBOX`. These are not pure-function proof obligations; they require scenario execution, fakes, recorders, and invariant checks over traces.

Z3 should facilitate DST in three concrete ways:

- Prove pure helpers used by DST invariants, so scenario tests do not duplicate low-level policy reasoning.
- Export policy constants or small pure policy helpers that both contracts and DST can depend on.
- Run `make verify_core` as an advisory Phase 0 signal until existing proof failures are fixed, then promote it into the fast gate for pure-core regressions.

Z3 should not replace DST for effectful or temporal behavior. It cannot by itself prove provider-call recording, env forwarding, filesystem sandbox materialization, package hydration, or multi-step loop telemetry unless those behaviors are first reduced to pure functions with explicit contracts. Some current compaction helpers also use higher-order or fold-shaped code that may need contract comments, wrapper functions, or refactoring before Z3 can prove useful claims locally.

## Layers

### Layer 0: Pure Policy DST

Tests pure helpers and policies:

- compaction thresholds
- token estimates
- message elision
- parser helpers
- cost arithmetic
- path/config normalization

This layer can run through `ailang test` or `ailang run` smokes.

### Layer 1: Loop-State DST

Tests `loop_v2` state transitions with scripted provider, extension, and tool behavior.

The first load-bearing seam is provider-call recording in the existing scripted provider path. Compaction is ephemeral: compacted messages are sent to the provider, while the loop recurses on full uncompacted history. Therefore tests must inspect provider-call payloads, not just returned messages.

### Layer 2: Harness-Boundary DST

Tests TypeScript harness behavior before AILANG starts:

- child env preparation
- sandbox-readable path materialization
- profile mirroring
- env allowlist/forwarding
- spawn arguments

This layer catches bugs like external `SYSTEM_MD` being unreadable under `AILANG_FS_SANDBOX`.

### Layer 3: End-to-End Deterministic Harness DST

Composes the TypeScript harness with a deterministic child/runtime probe or scripted AILANG loop. It must not use real providers or live network as its oracle.

## Core Components

DST will use:

- Scenario fixtures with stable ids.
- A normalized trace recorder.
- Reusable invariant functions.
- Scripted provider fakes returning `std/ai.StepResult`-shaped values.
- Extension hook fakes that can record inputs and return `PassThrough` or `Compacted`.
- Tool fakes for deterministic stdout/stderr/exit-code behavior.
- Harness-boundary fixtures for temp workspaces, external files, and env layouts.
- Seeded generators for fuzzing scenario parameters after fixed scenarios are stable.

Scenario ids are the stable public contract. Fixture representation can vary by layer in v1, but each scenario must report the same id in failures and traces.

Canonical trace events should include:

```text
scenario_start
harness_env_prepared
child_spawn_prepared
system_prompt_built
extension_pre_step_called
provider_call_prepared
provider_result
tool_policy_decision
tool_result_appended
loop_totals_updated
scenario_end
```

### Provider-Call Recording Contract

The first required Layer 1 seam is a recorder around the scripted provider path. For every provider call, the trace should record at least:

- scenario id and loop step index
- normalized message payload passed to `dispatch_step`
- pinned system-prefix projection
- tool schema names or ids, if present
- previous `last_input_tokens`
- provider result `input_tokens`, `output_tokens`, `finish_reason`, and tool-call ids
- selected compaction tier or enough input facts to recompute the tier
- whether persisted loop history remains uncompacted after the call

The recorder must not change production provider behavior. If full messages are too large for default output, the failure trace can include a bounded projection plus hashes, while the in-memory invariant checks can still inspect the complete payload.

## Initial Scenario Families

### Compaction

The compaction scenarios prove actual-token behavior and system-message pinning.

Canonical ids:

- `compaction.actual_tokens_drive_next_step`
- `compaction.system_messages_hidden_from_compactors`
- `compaction.emergency_exhaustion_estimate_gated`
- `compaction.actual_tokens_small_context_fail_open`
- `compaction.provider_payload_vs_uncompacted_history_pressure`

Important invariants:

- provider-call payload contains the pinned system prefix
- extension `on_pre_step` never receives system messages
- `last_input_tokens` carries forward from provider result
- actual-token path uses 60/75/85 tiers only when effective context is positive
- estimate fallback uses 70/85/95 tiers when `last_input_tokens <= 0`
- emergency entry is actual-token-gated, but exhaustion is estimate-gated
- tool-call IDs and tool-result IDs survive elision

### Harness Prompt Materialization

The harness scenarios prove runtime inputs are readable inside the sandbox.

Canonical ids:

- `harness.external_system_md_materialized`
- `harness.workspace_system_md_not_rewritten`
- `harness.missing_system_md_fails_loudly`
- `harness.system_md_forwarded_to_child_env`

Important invariants:

- child env `SYSTEM_MD` points to a sandbox-readable path
- materialized prompt content equals the original external file
- child env includes `AILANG_FS_SANDBOX=WORKDIR`
- non-empty configured system prompts produce non-empty runtime prompt observations

## Preconditions

Do not add generalized DST on top of known-red tests.

Before Layer 1 or Layer 3 DST is enabled:

1. Hydrate AILANG registry dependencies in CI and local setup.
2. Ensure every package imported by `src/core/ext/registry_generated.ail` is available.
3. Fix or retire stale compaction tests that still assume no output headroom, especially tests using `test/tiny`.
4. Update compaction source comments to document both tier tables.
5. Validate any AILANG test/property-test syntax against the local binary, not only MCP latest docs.

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 0: Restore Test Preconditions

- Add dependency hydration to the test workflow.
- Add a concrete import-resolution check for the full-loop path, for example `ailang check` on a script or test that imports `agent_loop_v2`.
- Repair stale compaction tests around `context_limit - 75000`.
- Track `make verify_core` in Phase 0, but do not block DST on it until current failed modules are resolved; skipped-contract reporting can remain non-blocking.
- Keep current pure compaction checks green.

### Phase 1: Make Existing Boundaries Inspectable

Start from existing infrastructure:

- `src/core/test/stub_step.ail`
- `src/core/agent_loop_v2.ail#run_v2_with_stub`
- existing `scripts/smoke_v2_*.ail`
- existing TypeScript runtime-process tests

Add provider-call recording to the scripted provider path. This is the first required seam.

### Phase 2: Add Scenario Runners

Initial files should stay small:

```text
scripts/smoke_v2_compaction_actual_dst.ail
src/tui/src/harness-dst.test.ts
src/tui/src/runtime-process-env.test.ts
```

Only introduce `src/core/test/dst/` after the smaller seams prove useful.

### Phase 3: Add Reusable Invariants

Implement common invariant helpers, including:

- `system_prompt_non_empty`
- `system_prompt_stable`
- `provider_calls_have_system_prefix`
- `system_messages_not_sent_to_pre_step`
- `tool_call_ids_preserved`
- `actual_tokens_select_compaction_tier`
- `provider_payload_compacted_but_history_uncompacted`
- `emergency_compaction_exhaustion_uses_estimate`
- `small_effective_context_fails_open`
- `sandbox_paths_readable_by_child`

### Phase 4: Add Seeded Fuzzing

Add seeded generators around fixed scenarios:

- message history sizes
- tool output sizes
- tool-call argument sizes
- token counts near thresholds
- extension decisions
- `SYSTEM_MD` path layouts
- profile mirror layouts

Every failure must print scenario id, seed, first failed invariant, and normalized trace.

## CI Shape

Fast PR gate:

```bash
ailang lock
make test_core
ailang check scripts/smoke_v2_compaction_actual_dst.ail
ailang run --caps IO --entry main scripts/smoke_v2_compaction_actual_dst.ail
cd src/tui && bun test src/harness-dst.test.ts
```

If `ailang lock` does not hydrate every registry dependency, CI must explicitly install missing packages before full-loop DST. The lock/install step is only successful when the full-loop import-resolution check passes.

Add `make verify_core` to the fast gate once existing proof failures are fixed. Until then, run it as advisory contract health so Z3 work can progress without blocking DST scenario coverage.

Expanded gate:

```bash
ailang lock
make test_dst
```

Nightly:

```bash
DST_SEEDS=500 make test_dst_seeded
```

Provider smokes remain optional and supplemental.

## Acceptance Criteria

The first DST implementation is acceptable when:

- package hydration plus import-resolution checks pass in CI
- pure-core contract verification is either advisory with known failures tracked, or blocking with no failed proofs
- known stale compaction tests are fixed or retired rather than ignored
- a compaction DST scenario can prove that the provider payload was compacted while persisted loop history stayed uncompacted
- the external `SYSTEM_MD` harness scenario fails against the buggy behavior from PR #76 and passes after materialization
- every DST failure prints scenario id, seed when applicable, first failed invariant, and a normalized trace
- no DST gate requires Ollama, OpenRouter, or live network

## Consequences

Positive:

- Regressions become reproducible without Ollama/OpenRouter.
- Known bug classes become reusable scenario families.
- The provider-call payload becomes observable, closing the main loop-state test gap.
- Harness-boundary failures become testable without a full agent run.
- Fuzzing can explore scenario parameters without losing deterministic replay.

Negative:

- Some production-safe seams must be added for observability.
- CI must reliably hydrate AILANG registry dependencies.
- Tests will need care to avoid duplicating policy constants that should be exported from source.
- Layer 1 and Layer 3 DST can be blocked by unrelated generated-registry imports until package hydration is fixed.

## Rejected Alternatives

### Real-provider E2E as the primary gate

Rejected because it is flaky, slow, expensive, and not deterministic.

### Pure helper tests only

Rejected because they cannot catch loop-state and harness-boundary failures.

### Extract a pure pre-provider helper first

Deferred. Extension `on_pre_step` carries broad effects, and the most important observation is the actual payload consumed by `dispatch_step`. Provider-call recording is the better first seam.

### Arbitrary black-box fuzzing

Rejected for v1. Fuzzing should be seeded, scenario-shaped, and invariant-driven.

## Open Questions

- Should compaction thresholds and output headroom be exported constants?
- Should scenario fixtures be AILANG records, JSON files, TypeScript objects, or layer-specific?
- Should traces be normalized JSONL everywhere, or should AILANG `std/trace` be used for Layer 1?
- How should virtual time be enabled for `std/clock`, if needed?

## Review Comments

_Reviewer: GLM 5.2 (model: `z-ai/glm-5.2`), 2026-06-27. Grounded against current source (`src/core/compaction.ail`, `agent_loop_v2.ail`, `runtime.ail`), git history, and repo layout. Compaction tier claims verified accurate: `compact_step_actual` uses 60/75/85 (`compaction.ail:162-166`); `compact_step` (estimate fallback) uses 70/85/95 (`compaction.ail:146-148`); `last_input_tokens` carries in `LoopTotals` (`agent_loop_v2.ail:170`) and gates the actual path at `agent_loop_v2.ail:1124`._

### R1. Dangling reference: PR #76

**Acceptance criterion** cites "the buggy behavior from PR #76," but no `#76` appears in git history, `.agent/prs/`, or `.agent/summaries/`. The actual `SYSTEM_MD` materialization work lives in commits `f585a7f`, `1e715a8`, `03a4610` (and duplicates), none of which reference PR #76; the highest tracked PR is `mot-20`. A load-bearing acceptance criterion must be verifiable. **Action:** re-point to the commit/PR that actually introduced the bug, or drop the number and describe the bug class ("out-of-workspace `SYSTEM_MD` unreadable under `AILANG_FS_SANDBOX`").

### R2. Precondition references a test path that does not exist

**Preconditions** name "stale compaction tests… especially tests using `test/tiny`" and "Repair stale compaction tests around `context_limit - 75000`." `src/core/test/` contains only `integration_tests.ail` and `stub_step.ail` — no `test/tiny`. Either the test was already deleted, the path is wrong, or the precondition is itself stale. A "fix the red tests" gate that cannot be located cannot gate Phase 1. **Action:** name the exact file and assertion, or strike the precondition.

### R3. Registry-import precondition is over-broad for L1

**Constraints** state "tests that import `agent_loop_v2` also import `src/core/ext/registry_generated.ail`." This is imprecise: `agent_loop_v2.ail:62` imports `stub_step`, not `registry_generated`; the registry import is in `runtime.ail:25` and only fires through `init_runtime_with_config` (`runtime.ail:27`, effect row `{Env, FS, Net}`). A Layer 1 test calling `run_v2_with_stub` with a synthetic `ExtRuntime` can bypass the registry entirely. **Action:** scope the "hard precondition" to tests that boot the real runtime, not all `agent_loop_v2` importers.

### R4. Trace format is a Phase 1 decision, not an open question

**Open Questions** asks "JSONL everywhere, or `std/trace` for Layer 1?" This blocks Phase 1, not Phase 4: the recorder is the first seam, and its format determines whether L1 tests run under `ailang test` (which may not permit arbitrary file I/O) or must be `ailang run` smokes. The Phase 3 invariant functions consume traces, so their interface depends on this. **Action:** decide in the ADR before Phase 1.

### R5. Compaction constants must be exported — this is a prerequisite, not a question

**Open Questions** asks "Should compaction thresholds and output headroom be exported constants?" The ADR's own Constraints warn "Tests will need care to avoid duplicating policy constants that should be exported from source." That is the answer: yes. Today `compaction.ail` inlines `75000` (line 60, 162) and the tier thresholds as literals (lines 146-148, 162-166). Hardcoding these in fixtures creates exactly the duplication the ADR warns against and makes `actual_tokens_select_compaction_tier` untrustworthy. **Action:** promote to Phase 0: export `OUTPUT_HEADROOM=75000`, `ACTUAL_TIERS={60,75,85}`, `ESTIMATE_TIERS={70,85,95}`.

> **AMENDED 2026-07-03** (phase-core ADR-001, review P2-R1/P3-R4 + plan-authoring finding
> G3): the actual/estimate split this finding was grounded on (2026-06-27) has since been
> **removed from source** — current `compaction.ail` is a single 70/85/95 estimate ladder
> (`compact_step_with_limit`, `:134-141`); `OUTPUT_HEADROOM`/`75000`, the 60/75/85 actual
> tiers, `compact_step_actual`, and `last_input_tokens` have no referent in `src/core`. The
> export remedy survives **in amended form**: the phase-core Phase A plan exports the single
> tier table (70/85/95 + keep-lasts 10/5/3/1) as named constants. Actual-token gating is now
> compactor-extension policy per phase-core D9 (ABI v3 `ExtCtx.telemetry`), not a core
> constant. Additionally, limits moved to the model catalog in `a7589b8` (2026-06-24):
> `context_limit_for` returns 0 for every model, so only the limit-parameterized entry
> points are live.

### R6. Fixture-format question is already resolved in-body

**Open Questions** asks the fixture format, yet **Core Components** already states "Fixture representation can vary by layer in v1." That is the decision. Re-listing it as a question signals indecision where the text has resolved it. **Action:** remove from Open Questions, or sharpen to "should scenario *ids* carry a version suffix when semantics change?"

### R7. Effect satisfaction (Env/FS/Net) is unspecified — the hardest part

The ADR wisely rejects "mature effect-handler mocking" but never specifies how Layers 1/3 satisfy `init_runtime_with_config`'s `{Env, FS, Net}` effect row (`runtime.ail:27`) deterministically. Unaddressed: (a) how `Env` effects resolve under `ailang test` vs `ailang run --caps IO`; (b) whether `Net` is stubbed at `std/ai.step` (the scripted provider) or lower; (c) whether `ailang test` honors `--caps`. Recent commits (`ada0ae9`, `2f32a99`, `3b72542`) show active effect-row migration pain — DST is the largest effectful consumer outside production. **Action:** add a per-layer effect-satisfaction strategy section before Phase 1.

### R8. Provider-call recorder invariant is self-contradictory

**Provider-Call Recording Contract** requires "the recorder must not change production provider behavior," while **Consequences** admits "production-safe seams must be added for observability." Any recorder observing the `dispatch_step` payload is a production-path change. The ADR never specifies the mechanism resolving this: pure-function wrapper at call sites? effect-handler tap (contradicts R7's no-mocking stance)? compile-time conditional (AILANG support unclear?). **Action:** pick one — test-gated seam (zero prod cost, accept conditional) or always-on telemetry (accept behavioral change, prove observational equivalence) — and state it.

### R9. Acceptance criterion scope vs. phasing mismatch

Acceptance requires "every DST failure prints scenario id, seed, first failed invariant, and a normalized trace." But the recorder lands in Phase 1, invariants in Phase 3, fuzzing in Phase 4. A Phase 1 smoke failing must already emit a normalized trace + scenario id — meaning the full recorder contract must exist in Phase 1, not "be added" in Phase 3. **Action:** narrow the criterion to "Phase 3+ failures" or state explicitly that Phase 1 traces are a structural subset.

### R10. AILANG version drift understated

Local binary is `v0.24.2` (verified: `ailang --version` → `v0.24.2`, commit `f88ff4e`); MCP exposes `latest=0.25.0`. The gap is a *minor* version, not a patch. This repo's history shows effect-row migrations and `std/ai` signature drift between minors (`stepWithStream`, `stepWithCache`, cache-token fields). The recorder contract and trace event names (`provider_call_prepared`, `tool_policy_decision`) depend on a specific `StepResult` shape; `agent_loop_v2.ail:266-282` already special-cases `cache_read_input_tokens`/`cache_creation_input_tokens`. **Action:** pin DST contract validation to `v0.24.2` and define a re-validation trigger for minor bumps.

### R11. Layer 3 "runtime probe" is undefined

L3's linchpin — "a deterministic child/runtime probe or scripted AILANG loop" — names two options without defining either. Is the probe a minimal AILANG script emitting canned `StepResult`s? A runtime fork with `std/ai.step` stubbed? A separate binary? L3 carries the `SYSTEM_MD` acceptance criterion, so the probe's contract (what it must emit, what it must refuse) must be defined before that criterion is achievable. **Action:** specify the probe contract in the L3 section.

### R12. CI gate references Makefile targets that do not exist

**CI Shape** lists `make test_dst` and `make test_dst_seeded`. The Makefile currently defines only `test_core` and `test: test_core` (verified). These targets must be created. **Action:** flag them as Phase 0/2 deliverables or add a "CI targets to add" subsection.

### R13. `ailang lock` sufficiency check is unspecified

Constraints correctly reject `ailang lock` as sufficient alone, but the follow-up "import-resolution check" is only exemplified as `ailang check scripts/smoke_v2_compaction_actual_dst.ail` — a single script, not "all generated-registry imports." **Action:** specify the probe as `ailang check` on a test importing `init_runtime_with_config`, which transitively pulls `registry_generated`.

### R14. Scenario id stability has no versioning scheme

**Core Components** asserts "Scenario ids are the stable public contract" but proposes no scheme. If `compaction.actual_tokens_drive_next_step` changes semantics across fixture revisions, id stability is false comfort. **Action:** specify whether ids are immutable (new id for changed semantics) or versioned (`...@v2`).

### R15. Emergency-compaction invariant conflates entry and exit

Listed invariant `emergency_compaction_exhaustion_uses_estimate` is correct but ambiguous. Source shows: *entry* to emergency is path-dependent (actual path: ≥85% of effective; estimate path: ≥95%), while *exit* (exhaustion `Err`) is always estimate-gated via `usage_percent` in `try_emergency_compaction` (`compaction.ail:123-141`). The ADR's phrasing merges the two. **Action:** split into `emergency_entry_path_dependent` and `emergency_exhaustion_always_estimate_gated`, or restate the invariant to distinguish entry from exhaustion.

> **AMENDED 2026-07-03** (with R5, same grounds): the actual entry path no longer exists in
> source — emergency entry is now solely estimate-gated (≥95%, single ladder), so the
> entry/exit distinction this finding drew has collapsed to one path and
> `emergency_entry_path_dependent` is unrepresentable. The surviving invariant is
> `emergency_exhaustion_always_estimate_gated`. Note also (verified empirically 2026-07-03,
> `smoke_v2_compaction_tiers.ail` fix): emergency elision *recovers* tool-heavy overload
> (keep-last 3, then 1); exhaustion `Err` requires non-tool content, which elision never
> touches — an invariant nuance any successor scenario should encode.

### What is accurate

Compaction tier facts (60/75/85 actual; 70/85/95 estimate), `last_input_tokens` carry-forward, ephemeral-compaction-vs-uncompacted-history, the rejection of real-provider E2E and arbitrary fuzzing for v1, and the Phase 0 "restore red tests before adding DST" discipline are all correct and well-reasoned. The provider-call payload observation is the right first seam.

> **AMENDED 2026-07-03**: the tier facts above were accurate at this review's grounding
> (2026-06-27) but the actual/estimate split and `last_input_tokens` carry-forward were
> subsequently removed from source — see the R5/R15 amendment notes.
