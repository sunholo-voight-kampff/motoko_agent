# ADR-002: Compaction DST, re-grounded on the phase-core scaffold

Date: 2026-07-06
Status: Proposed
As-built: the implemented DST framework is documented in `design_docs/implemented/motoko_agent/m-motoko-dst-framework.md`
Pinned toolchain: AILANG **v0.26.0** (commit `3b52a24`); `ailang.lock` → `ailang_version: "v0.26.0"`

Relates to:
- `001_DST/ADR-001-deterministic-simulation-testing-architecture.md` (this project) — the original
  DST architecture, authored **2026-06-27 against the pre-refactor loop**. This ADR **supersedes its
  compaction sections** ("Initial Scenario Families → Compaction", the compaction canonical ids, and
  the compaction-specific findings R5/R15) and re-grounds them on the shipped phase-core
  architecture. ADR-001's layer model, harness-boundary (PR #76) scenarios, and CI discipline are
  retained by reference; only the compaction design is re-pointed.
- `004_phase_core_refactor/ADR-001-phase-oriented-core.md` **D9** — the operator decision that made
  compaction *policy* (elision ladders, tiers, AI summarization) extension-resident; core keeps only
  the measurement scaffold. The shipped structural default is `motoko_ext_compaction_structural`
  (elision only — it carries no AI summarizer); actual-token gating is deferred to ABI v3
  `ExtCtx.telemetry`. This ADR targets the architecture D9 produced.
- `004_phase_core_refactor/ADR-002-send-gate-and-dst-for-system-prompt-and-overflow.md` — landed the
  typed send-gate (`seal_compacted_payload`) and the ledger observable (`provider_call_prepared`
  carrying `system_prefix_chars`). This ADR **reuses that ledger as the DST recorder** instead of
  building the new one 001_DST/ADR-001 proposed.
- `.agent/research/DST/deterministic-simulation-testing-for-agent-loop-compaction.md` — the
  2026-06-27 research draft. Superseded in the same way as 001_DST/ADR-001; its 8 scenarios are
  reconciled against the current architecture in the de-duplication map below.
- PR **#75** (`fix(compaction): reliable triggering`) — the incident whose bug classes this DST is
  meant to turn into standing law.

## TL;DR

The phase-core refactor **landed the very infrastructure** 001_DST/ADR-001 was designed to build,
and **removed from source** the actual-token machinery its compaction scenarios asserted over. So
this ADR is mostly *subtractive*: it retires the stale recorder/constants/headroom design and
re-points the surviving invariants at what shipped.

**Decision:**

1. **The ledger is the recorder.** DST asserts over the existing phase-core ledger
   (`provider_call_prepared` with `system_prefix_count`/`system_prefix_chars`, and the `error`
   event), not a new provider-call recorder. This dissolves 001_DST/ADR-001's hardest open findings
   (R4 trace format, R8 recorder seam) rather than resolving them.
2. **Scope split (D1).** DST the **estimate ladder that ships today** now, as standing Layer-1 law,
   reusing the `phase_c_l1_scenarios.ail` harness. **Specify** the actual-token / qwen-threshold DST
   precisely but **gate it** on the un-landed ABI v3 `ExtCtx.telemetry` seam plus a fake `ai_step`
   port. DST progress is not blocked on the ABI build.
3. **Qwen's window is guarded once; the estimate tiers are qwen-agnostic (D2).** The estimate tiers
   are **limit-relative** (`usage_percent = tokens*100/limit`), so tier logic is identical at any
   window — the tier scenario injects a **small tractable `ctx.context_limit`** with tiny fixtures
   (as the live-loop smoke does at `test/tiny`'s limit 100), *not* qwen's `262144` with a generated
   700 KB fixture. Qwen's specific window only matters for the (gated) actual-token path; in the
   estimate path "qwen" is the model label plus one `{Env, FS}` scenario asserting
   `catalog_context_limit_for(...) == 262144` (`.motoko/model-catalog.json:43`). There is no pure
   limit function — the only source is the effectful `catalog_context_limit_for` — so the catalog
   guard is the sole place the `262144` literal appears.

The now-scenarios ship with no ABI change — four pure under `--caps IO` (policy ones also need the
compaction package resolvable, finding 6), one catalog guard under `--caps IO,Env,FS`; the
actual-token half is documented as a follow-on that unblocks when D9's ABI v3 lands.

---

## Context

"DST for compaction with the qwen model" reads, from PR #75, as a request to prove that **actual
provider `input_tokens` from step N drive compaction before step N+1** — the qwen window (262144),
the 75k output headroom, and the 60/75/85 actual-token tiers. That behavior **no longer exists in
the codebase.** The phase-core refactor (004 ADR-001 D9) dissolved it, and 001_DST/ADR-001's own
2026-07-03 amendment (finding R5) records the removal:

> "the actual/estimate split … has since been **removed from source** … `OUTPUT_HEADROOM`/`75000`,
> the 60/75/85 actual tiers, `compact_step_actual`, and `last_input_tokens` have no referent in
> `src/core`. Actual-token gating is now compactor-extension policy per phase-core D9 (ABI v3
> `ExtCtx.telemetry`) … `context_limit_for` returns 0 for every model."

Writing scenarios against the research draft or 001_DST/ADR-001 unamended would assert over dead
concepts. This ADR re-establishes what is real at HEAD and splits the work accordingly.

## Investigation findings (grounded at HEAD, toolchain v0.26.0 / `3b52a24`)

1. **The shipped compactor is estimate-only, and its live entry is `compact_for_pre_step`.**
   `packages/motoko-ext-compaction-structural/compaction_structural.ail` (module
   `sunholo/motoko_ext_compaction_structural/compaction_structural`) is a single estimate ladder:
   `elide_tier_pct()=70` (`:14`), `elide_hard_tier_pct()=85` (`:16`), `emergency_pct()=95` (`:18`),
   keep-lasts `10/5/3/1` (`:20-26`), `elide_old_tool_results` (`:72`). The **live** compactor is the
   `pure` hook `compact_for_pre_step(ctx, msgs) -> PreStepDecision` (`:117`), registered as
   `on_pre_step` in `register.ail:34`; it gates on `usage_percent_with_limit(msgs, ctx.context_limit)`
   — **never on actual tokens** — and returns `PassThrough | Compacted` only: **it has no exhaustion
   `Err`**. When even the emergency tier (keep-last 3 → 1) can't reduce further, it returns
   `PassThrough` and **defers exhaustion to core `seal`**. All tier constants are already
   `export pure func`, so DST imports them; no fixture may duplicate a threshold literal.

   `compact_step_with_limit(msgs, model, limit) -> Result[…, string]` (`:90`) — the only entry that
   returns the `"compaction_exhausted"` `Err` — is **not on the live path**: nothing in `src/core`
   calls it (it was removed from `src/core/compaction.ail`), and its only callers are
   `src/core/test/integration_tests.ail:43` and the smoke scripts. DST-ing *its* exhaustion would
   test off-path code; live exhaustion is core `seal`, already guarded by `oversized_payload_rejected`
   (004 ADR-002). The extension also carries its own inline unit tests (e.g. `compact_for_pre_step`
   at `:213`), so the DST value-add is the **L1 reporting-contract layer** over them (scenario id +
   invariant + trace), mirroring 004 ADR-002's rationale for `oversized_payload_rejected`, not first
   coverage.

2. **The ABI v3 telemetry seam is not landed.** The extension consumes `ExtCtx` from
   `pkg/sunholo/motoko_ext_abi/types` at **ABI v2.2.0** (`ailang.toml:7`, `ailang.lock:43`). That
   `ExtCtx` — mirrored in-tree at `src/core/ext/types.ail:11` — carries `context_limit` but **no
   `telemetry` / `last_input_tokens` field**. The actual-token-gated policy D9 promised therefore has
   no seam to run through, and no code references it. Adding it is an ABI major bump (registry
   publish), not an in-tree edit.

3. **The ledger already is the recorder.** 004 ADR-002 shipped `provider_call_prepared` carrying
   `system_prefix_count` and `system_prefix_chars`, emitted by the single send-gate authority
   (`seal_compacted_payload`, `src/core/phase_vocab.ail`), plus the typed `error` event. This is
   exactly the normalized boundary trace 001_DST/ADR-001 proposed to build with a bespoke
   `dispatch_step` recorder (its R8 self-contradiction: "recorder must not change production
   behavior" vs "production-safe seams must be added"). The recorder question is moot: the trace
   exists and is production.

4. **Much of the old invariant list is already core-DST law.** `scripts/phase_c_l1_scenarios.ail`
   already runs 12/12 under `--caps IO`, including system-prefix pinning (the head system run is
   pinned out of the `CompactableSegment` by construction — `split_for_compaction` +
   unexported `MkSegment`), `compactor_chain_order_is_registry_order`,
   `invalid_stage_skipped_chain_continues`, `oversized_payload_rejected` /
   `actual_token_pressure_defers_to_seal` (the seal exhaustion gate), and `empty_system_prompt_rejected`.
   The genuinely-uncovered residue is the **live hook's own policy** — the estimate tier ladder and
   the emergency-recovery-or-defer behavior — plus everything actual-token.

5. **The only limit source is the effectful catalog — there is no pure limit function.** The pure
   `context_limit_for` the 2026-07-03 amendment referred to has since been **deleted entirely**; it
   has no definition at HEAD (verified: no `func context_limit_for` in `src/`). The sole limit source
   is `catalog_context_limit_for(model)` (`src/core/context_usage.ail:50`), effect row `{Env, FS}`,
   reading `.motoko/model-catalog.json` where `"ollama/qwen3.6:35b-a3b-mxfp8": 262144` (`:43`); it is
   the live limit for every send (`rpc.ail:106,:212`; `session.ail:972,:994,:1389`). A pure scenario
   cannot call it, so injecting qwen's limit is **mandatory**, not merely preferred (D2).

6. **Testing the compactor policy requires importing the extension package.** The tier ladder, the
   elision helper, and the constants live only in `pkg/sunholo/motoko_ext_compaction_structural`.
   `scripts/phase_c_l1_scenarios.ail` imports only `src/core/*` — so the policy scenarios have a
   **heavier dependency profile than phase_c_l1**: the package must be resolvable. In this checkout it
   is (an `ailang check` on `src/core/test/integration_tests.ail`, which imports the pkg, passes
   without an explicit `ailang lock`), but that resolution is a **precondition** CI must guarantee
   (001_DST/ADR-001 Phase 0 hydration), not a free property. Separately, `scripts/smoke_catalog_compaction.ail`
   is **stale/red** — it imports `compact_step_with_limit` from `src/core/compaction`, where the
   function no longer exists — and must be fixed or retired before piling DST on top (001_DST/ADR-001
   Phase 0 discipline).

## Decision drivers

- Don't assert over removed concepts. Every DST invariant must have a referent at HEAD.
- Reuse the phase-core ledger and the `phase_c_l1` harness pattern; do not build a parallel recorder
  or a second scenario framework (001_DST/ADR-001 "use existing seams first").
- Target the **live** compactor (`compact_for_pre_step`), not the off-path `compact_step_with_limit`,
  so scenarios assert over what actually runs.
- Import the extension's exported tier constants; never duplicate a threshold literal in a fixture
  (the surviving, amended form of 001_DST/ADR-001 R5).
- Keep DST decoupled from the ABI v3 build: an estimate-path guard has standing value now and must
  not wait on a registry publish.
- No scenario needs network or effect-handler mocking. The four pure scenarios run under `--caps IO`;
  the one catalog-binding scenario needs `--caps IO,Env,FS`. The **core-only** scenarios match the
  `phase_c_l1` dependency profile; the **policy** scenarios additionally require the compaction
  package to be resolvable (a hydration precondition, per finding 6), because the ladder lives only
  there.

## Decision detail

### 1. The ledger is the DST oracle (retire the recorder)

DST reads the phase-core ledger events already emitted by the send-gate authority:
`provider_call_prepared` (present exactly on calls that proceed; carries `system_prefix_chars`) and
`error` (`code: "SystemPromptEmpty"` on the rejected path). Assertions match structured fields
(`code`, `system_prefix_chars`), never message text. 001_DST/ADR-001's Provider-Call Recording
Contract (its §"Core Components", findings R4/R8) is **withdrawn**: the trace format is the shipped
schema-v1 KV projection; the seam is the existing emit sites; there is no new production change to
justify.

### 2. Scope split — estimate-path now, actual-token specified-but-gated (D1)

**Land now (Layer-1, `phase_c_l1_scenarios.ail` style, `--caps IO`, pure):** scenarios over the live
hook and the extension's exported pure funcs, plus the core scaffold (`split_for_compaction` /
`segment_messages`) and the catalog. These become standing law for the compactor that actually ships.

**Specify but gate:** the actual-token scenarios and the #75.3 summarizer scenario require (a) ABI v3
`ExtCtx.telemetry` and (b) a fake `ai_step` port. This ADR fixes their canonical ids and invariants
so they are implementable the day the seam lands, and names the seam as the single blocker. No DST
gate depends on the ABI build until then.

### 3. Qwen-agnostic tiers; one catalog-binding guard (D2)

The live hook reads its budget from `ctx.context_limit` (the `ExtCtx` literal follows the pkg's
test-helper shape, `compaction_structural.ail:197-211`). Because the tiers are limit-relative, the
tier scenario injects a **small tractable `context_limit`** (tiny fixtures cross the thresholds — the
`test/tiny` limit-100 pattern the live-loop smoke already uses), and uses `model:
"ollama/qwen3.6:35b-a3b-mxfp8"` only as a label. The real qwen window is asserted **once**, in a
separate `{Env, FS}` scenario: `catalog_context_limit_for("ollama/qwen3.6:35b-a3b-mxfp8") == 262144`.
So `262144` appears in exactly one place and never as a free-floating magic number, and the fast tier
scenario stays a fast pure scenario.

### 4. Proposed scenarios

The live-loop *outcome* (no-elision / tier-1-silent / tier-3-`compaction_exhausted`) is already
covered by the Layer-2 smoke `smoke_v2_compaction_full_loop.ail` (`run_v2_with_scripted_ports`, real
compactor registered), but that smoke needs the broad loop cap set + network allowances and asserts
only Ok/Err, not the per-tier keep-last count. These scenarios are the **fast, pure, `--caps IO`
tier-decision-granularity** layer under it.

**Policy-path over the live hook (implement now; import the compaction pkg, per finding 6):**

- **`compaction.estimate_tier_ladder`** — `compact_for_pre_step(ctx, msgs)` at a small injected
  `ctx.context_limit` (tiny fixtures, `test/tiny`-style), asserting against the *imported* constants:
  below `elide_tier_pct()` ⇒ `PassThrough`; `>= elide_tier_pct()` ⇒ `Compacted` keep-last
  `elide_keep_last()`; `>= elide_hard_tier_pct()` ⇒ keep-last `elide_hard_keep_last()`;
  `>= emergency_pct()` ⇒ the emergency tier. (`model: "ollama/qwen…"` label only; tiers are
  qwen-agnostic, per D2 — the granularity full_loop omits is the exact keep-last per tier.)
- **`compaction.tool_shape_preserved_by_elision`** — `elide_old_tool_results(msgs, keep_last)`
  preserves list length and order, every `tool_call_id`, assistant `tool_calls` `id`/`name`/`arguments`,
  leaves non-tool messages untouched, and preserves the recent-`keep_last` tier verbatim.
- **`compaction.emergency_recovery_or_defer`** — at `>= emergency_pct()`, `compact_for_pre_step`
  **recovers** tool-heavy overload via keep-last-3 then keep-last-1 (returns `Compacted`); when even
  keep-last-1 cannot reduce (non-tool content dominates — elision never touches non-tool content,
  the amended 001_DST/ADR-001 R15 nuance), it returns **`PassThrough`, deferring exhaustion to
  `seal`**. This scenario asserts the recover-or-defer behavior; the exhaustion itself is core
  `seal`, covered by `oversized_payload_rejected` — **not re-asserted here**.

**Core-scaffold scenario (implement now; core-only, exactly phase_c_l1's profile):**

- **`compaction.segment_excludes_system_prefix`** — over `split_for_compaction` /
  `segment_messages`: given messages led by a system run, the built `CompactableSegment` (hence what
  any compactor can ever receive) contains no `role == "system"` message. This tests the construction
  invariant at the seam that actually enforces it, not `compact_for_pre_step` in isolation (which
  would only echo hand-built input).

**Catalog-binding scenario (implement now; core, `{Env, FS}`):**

- **`compaction.catalog_limit_qwen`** — the single `qwen → 262144` guard from D2.

**Gated on ABI v3 `ExtCtx.telemetry` + fake `ai_step` port (specify only):**

- **`compaction.actual_tokens_drive_next_step`** — when telemetry `last_input_tokens > 0`, tier
  selection uses the actual value, not the char estimate. This one is a **loop** property (step N's
  telemetry drives step N+1), so its home is the existing live-loop harness
  `run_v2_with_scripted_ports` (`src/core/test/scripted_ports.ail`), not a pure hook call — once the
  telemetry seam lets a scripted `input_tokens` reach `compact_for_pre_step`.
- **`compaction.actual_tokens_small_context_fail_open`** — `effective <= 0` (limit at/below headroom)
  fails open in the actual path (the estimate half — `limit <= 0` ⇒ `Ok` — is already unit-tested at
  `phase_vocab` `test_seal_compacted_payload_fail_open_limit_zero`).
- **`compaction.summarizer_uses_agent_model`** (#75.3) — the AI summarizer runs against the agent's
  own model (qwen locally) via an injected fake `ai_step` port, never a dead cloud default.

### 5. De-duplication map (do not re-implement)

| Old canonical id (001_DST/ADR-001 / research draft) | Status at HEAD |
|---|---|
| `compaction.system_messages_hidden_from_compactors` | Enforced by construction (`split_for_compaction` strips the system prefix; `MkSegment` unexported); new guard is `segment_excludes_system_prefix` over the construction seam |
| `compaction.provider_payload_vs_uncompacted_history_pressure` | **Covered** by `project_prep_vs_uncompacted_history_pressure` + `actual_token_pressure_defers_to_seal` |
| `compaction.emergency_exhaustion_estimate_gated` | Exhaustion is core `seal`, covered by `oversized_payload_rejected`; the **live hook's** emergency *recovery* is new (`emergency_recovery_or_defer`) — the hook never exhausts |
| `compaction.actual_tokens_drive_next_step` | **Gated** (no telemetry seam) |
| `compaction.actual_tokens_small_context_fail_open` | Estimate half unit-tested; actual half **gated** |

## Preconditions (before implementing)

- The compaction package `pkg/sunholo/motoko_ext_compaction_structural` must be resolvable for the
  policy scenarios (finding 6); CI must guarantee it (001_DST/ADR-001 Phase 0 hydration + an
  import-resolution check on a pkg-importer such as `integration_tests.ail`).
- **Fix or retire `scripts/smoke_catalog_compaction.ail`** — it is red at HEAD (imports
  `compact_step_with_limit` from `src/core/compaction`, which no longer defines it). Do not add DST on
  top of a red smoke.

## Out of scope

- **Landing ABI v3 `ExtCtx.telemetry`** and the fake `ai_step` port. Named as the blocker for the
  gated scenarios; owned by a separate build WI, not this DST work.
- **Re-homing the 60/75/85 actual tiers + headroom** into the extension. That is the ABI-v3 build,
  not DST.
- **#75.1** (chars/4 over-count) beyond what `estimate_tokens_messages` unit tests already assert.
- **Harness-boundary (PR #76) DST.** Retained from 001_DST/ADR-001; the in-core symptom is already
  guarded by 004 ADR-002's `empty_system_prompt_rejected`.

## Acceptance criteria

1. The four **pure** now-scenarios (the three policy + `segment_excludes_system_prefix`) run green
   under `ailang run --caps IO`, no network, no effect-handler mocking; the three policy scenarios
   import `pkg/sunholo/motoko_ext_compaction_structural` (resolvable per Preconditions),
   `segment_excludes_system_prefix` imports only `src/core/*`. `catalog_limit_qwen` is `{Env, FS}`
   (reads the catalog file) — it runs under `--caps IO,Env,FS`, either as a separate tiny gate or an
   Env/FS-capable sibling harness, not the pure `--caps IO` list.
2. The policy scenarios assert against **imported** extension constants, not literals; a grep proves
   no tier threshold is hardcoded in the scenario file.
3. Scenarios target the **live** hook `compact_for_pre_step` (not `compact_step_with_limit`);
   `emergency_recovery_or_defer` asserts recover (tool-heavy) vs `PassThrough`-defer (non-tool
   content) and does **not** assert an exhaustion `Err` (that is `seal`, covered elsewhere). Every
   failure names scenario id + first failed invariant (the phase-C reporting contract).
4. `catalog_limit_qwen` proves `qwen → 262144` in one place; the policy scenarios' injected
   `context_limit` references that value, not a second copy.
5. The three gated scenarios are specified with ids + invariants and marked blocked-on-ABI-v3; none
   is registered in a live harness list until the seam lands.
6. No scenario depends on effect-handler mocking, real providers, or a bespoke provider-call recorder.

## Consequences

Positive: the compactor that actually ships gains standing `--caps IO` regression law; the DST design
stops asserting over removed concepts; the ledger's role as the trace oracle is made explicit,
collapsing the old recorder findings; the actual-token work has a precise, ready spec the moment ABI
v3 lands.

Negative / accepted: the headline PR #75 behavior (actual tokens beat estimate) remains **untested
until the ABI seam is built** — this ADR makes that gap explicit rather than papering over it with
scenarios that would assert over dead code. The qwen limit is injected in pure scenarios (guarded
once by `catalog_limit_qwen`), a deliberate seam between pure policy and the effectful catalog.

## Rejected alternatives

- **Write the actual-token/qwen scenarios now** (per the research draft / unamended ADR-001) —
  rejected: `compact_step_actual`, `last_input_tokens`, the 60/75/85 tiers, and the 75k headroom have
  no referent at HEAD; the scenarios would not compile or would assert over nothing.
- **Build a provider-call recorder around `dispatch_step`** (ADR-001 §Provider-Call Recording) —
  rejected: the phase-core ledger already emits the normalized boundary trace; a second recorder
  duplicates it and reintroduces the R8 production-change tension.
- **Block all compaction DST on landing ABI v3 first** — rejected: couples standing regression value
  for the shipped estimate compactor to a cross-repo registry publish; D1 decouples them.
- **Duplicate tier thresholds as fixture literals** — rejected: the extension exports them as pure
  funcs; import them (amended ADR-001 R5).

## Decision log

- **D1** (2026-07-06): DST the **shipped estimate ladder** now; **specify but gate** the actual-token
  and summarizer scenarios on ABI v3 `ExtCtx.telemetry` + a fake `ai_step` port. DST is not blocked on
  the ABI build.
- **D2** (2026-07-06): qwen enters pure scenarios as an **injected `262144` limit** + model label;
  one effectful `catalog_limit_qwen` scenario guards the catalog binding.
- **D3** (2026-07-06): the **phase-core ledger is the DST recorder**; 001_DST/ADR-001's bespoke
  recorder and its R4/R8 findings are withdrawn.
- **D4** (2026-07-06): supersede the **compaction sections** of 001_DST/ADR-001 (canonical ids, R5/R15
  compaction findings); retain its layer model, harness-boundary scenarios, and CI discipline by
  reference.

## Grounding and anchor log (HEAD, v0.26.0 / `3b52a24`)

- Extension: `packages/motoko-ext-compaction-structural/compaction_structural.ail` — tiers `:14/:16/:18`,
  keep-lasts `:20-26`, `elide_old_tool_results:72`, **live hook** `compact_for_pre_step:117` (pure,
  `PreStepDecision`, no exhaustion `Err`), ctx test-helper shape `:197-211`, inline unit test `:213`;
  **off-path** `compact_step_with_limit:90` (the only `"compaction_exhausted"` `Err`, callers:
  `integration_tests.ail:43` + smokes). Hook registration `register.ail:34` (`on_pre_step`). ABI dep
  `ailang.toml:7` = `2.2.0`, `ailang.lock:43`.
- ABI `ExtCtx` (no `telemetry`): consumed from `pkg/sunholo/motoko_ext_abi/types` (registry cache,
  ABI 2.2.0); in-tree mirror `src/core/ext/types.ail:11`.
- Core scaffold: `src/core/compaction.ail` `estimate_tokens_messages:17`, `usage_percent_with_limit:25`,
  `exhaustion_pct:30`; send-gate `src/core/phase_vocab.ail` `seal_compacted_payload` + `SealError`
  (post 004 ADR-002); `catalog_context_limit_for:50` in `src/core/context_usage.ail` (`{Env, FS}`),
  live at `rpc.ail:106,:212` and `session.ail:972,:994,:1389`. No pure `context_limit_for` exists
  (deleted; the 2026-07-03 amendment's "returns 0" claim is itself stale).
- Model catalog: `.motoko/model-catalog.json:43` → `"ollama/qwen3.6:35b-a3b-mxfp8": 262144`.
- Existing L1 harness: `scripts/phase_c_l1_scenarios.ail` (12 scenarios, `--caps IO`, imports only
  `src/core/*`); scenario-builder + `main` list pattern to extend.
- Existing live-loop seam: `run_v2_with_scripted_ports` (`src/core/test/scripted_ports.ail`) drives
  the real `loop_v2` with scripted ports; `scripts/smoke_v2_compaction_full_loop.ail` uses it (real
  compactor registered) to assert live-loop compaction outcomes incl. `compaction_exhausted` — but at
  the **broad loop cap set + `--net-allow-*`**, asserting Ok/Err only. This is the home for the gated
  actual-token *loop* scenario.
- Stale/red at HEAD: `scripts/smoke_catalog_compaction.ail` (imports `compact_step_with_limit` from
  `src/core/compaction`, absent). `smoke_v2_compaction_tiers.ail` checks green but tests the off-path
  `compact_step_with_limit`.
