# ADR-001: Deterministic Test-World Architecture for Motoko Logical-Fault DST

Date: 2026-07-24
Status: **Accepted 2026-08-02** as an architecture decision, on the scoped
architecture-acceptance review recorded below: both reviewers returned *Accept with conditions*, and
every condition is applied in the pass that carries this line. Preceded by an author self-review, a
streaming spike, two independent reviews, a vertical spike through the real driver, an AILANG v0.31.0
upstream recheck, three independent verifications of the F1–F6 revision, and fourteen delta reviews
of correction passes two through eight.

**What "Accepted" covers, and what it does not.** Accepted means D1–D11 are the selected architecture
and the decision is sound, internally coherent, and implementable on the pinned substrate. It does
**not** mean the DST name is earned, and it does not clear the external prerequisite. Two things
remain, both finite and neither self-regenerating:

1. **An external prerequisite for D1's streaming-trace parity and for the name**: the upstream
   recorded-stream API must land in a *released* AILANG, the toolchain must be repinned, and the
   positive integration probe must pass. A fork prototype does not satisfy it. Nine correction passes
   and fourteen delta reviews moved it exactly zero, because nothing in this repository can.
2. **Four deferred gate mechanisms**, each with a stated acceptance criterion in *Gate mechanisms:
   built, and deferred*. They block the **name**, not this decision. Classifier 3 was admitted as the
   fourth on 2026-08-06 by both acceptance reviewers jointly, on the architecture test recorded under
   that table. **The fifth mechanism is built, and it also blocks the name**: classifier 1 passes its
   criterion at HEAD only because that criterion had no coverage clause, so the reviewers amended the
   criterion in the same act — see the qualification under the table.

**An earlier revision listed "the latest correction pass has not been independently verified" as a
peer blocker, and that was a mistake of kind, not of fact.** It is true after every pass by
construction, so it regenerates with each edit and can never be discharged; carrying it as a peer of
the external prerequisite made this ADR un-acceptable in principle. Measured across the loop it
produced: findings per delta round of 15, 12, 16, 16, 17, 19, 20 — bottoming out at round two and
rising monotonically after, while every individual round looked like progress. The retrospective is in
`NOTE-review-loop-retrospective.md` and the standing discipline in
`.agent/meta-decisions/measure-review-loop-convergence-and-build-detectors-instead-of-specifying-them.md`.

What replaced it is the two-item list above. D1–D11 were re-derived and confirmed by every round
since the F1–F6 verifications, reopened by none, and ruled sound by both acceptance reviewers, who
independently applied the test *"if all three deferred mechanisms turned out unbuildable, would
D1–D11 still be the right architecture?"* and both answered yes, because each mechanism's absence
degrades conservatively. **That application was to the three mechanisms deferred on 2026-08-02 and it
is left as the historical record it is.** The same two reviewers applied the same test to
classifier 3 on 2026-08-06, jointly and independently of the amendment review that first proposed it,
and admitted it as the fourth; that application is recorded under
[*Gate mechanisms: built, and deferred*](#adr-gate-mechanisms) and is **not** a citation of the
review's.

**What is required next is not another delta review of a correction pass.** The loop those rounds
ran has been closed deliberately; see the Status note above. What remains is a scoped architecture
review if one is wanted, the four deferred mechanisms, classifier 1's repair against its amended
criterion, and the external release event.
F1, F2, F3, F5, F6, the narrowed D1 blocking clause, the upstream return-shape ruling, and M2 were
each independently confirmed by all three verifications, and D6.1's zero-`RunSummary` claim by two of
the three. The fourteen delta reviews additionally confirmed D4's clock count (13) and routing state,
corrections C3/C4/C5/C9/C14, every configuration fact, and — in the fourth-pass round, by two
independent three-module probes — that the extension-model-path **exclusion is the right
disposition** and that `ProviderState`'s home in `src/core/ports.ail` is **buildable as specified**.
None of that is reopened.

**The fourth pass answered a finding that changed sequencing; the fifth corrects what that answer
claimed it cost.** Both delta reviews of the third pass found a second call through the
`Ports.model_step` seam — `src/core/session.ail:662`, inside `ext_ai_step` — behind an `ExtPorts` ABI
that cannot return a successor. The fourth pass excluded extension-issued model calls from the
interim seam and called such a profile "not conformance-eligible". **That was stronger than D5
licenses**, as both fourth-pass reviews found: D5's machinery already handles exclusion correctly, and
exclusion costs *coverage*, not conformance. The rule is stated at six sites — an
extension that **calls** a classifier-2 `ExtPorts` field must have **every hook it registers**
excluded, and installing one without that is a profile-definition rejection, because the un-excluded
path discards world state with no fail-closed signal. Implementation Handoff item 2 remains a
**partial** cursor fix.

**"Stated once" was the sixth pass's claim and it was false**, at this paragraph and at D5's
validation bullet: both still carried the abandoned per-hook, call-graph phrasing while D1 declared it
retired. The honest claim is the one above — six normative sites, substantively aligned — and a
reader who finds a seventh saying something else should treat that as the defect. **They are not
word-identical**, and two passes asserted that they were; the documentation check named below is what
replaces the assertion.

**The second correction pass marked an open defect in D5 that was itself misdiagnosed, and both
delta reviews overturned it.** That marker claimed the routing audit failed open because
`tools/code-graph` discards calls through function-valued seams. The discarded call
(`ports.model_step(...)`) is a *routed* seam call, which is precisely what should be absent from an
ambient-effect inventory, and the parser does resolve direct ambient calls through its bare-import
path. The genuine disqualifiers are scope and granularity: `PROFILES["core"]` is `("src/core",)` and
never contained `packages/`, so the audit as scoped missed every extension-package site; and the
emitted rows are not sites. D5 obligation 2 is repaired accordingly — a conservative textual site
inventory over explicit `src` + `packages` roots — and the misdiagnosis is recorded there rather than
deleted, because a wrong diagnosis that survives into a fix is the more instructive half.

**No pass from the third onward carries an exhaustive-edit table, deliberately.** The second pass
shipped one (C1–C14) and it was incomplete: it disclosed only the D6.1 narrowing as post-dating
`d3bd9cd`, while `5eadee7` also added a Status paragraph and the D5 open-defect block. Both delta
reviews caught the omission. Every pass is now committed before it is reviewed, so a delta reviewer
should read `git log` and diff the commits rather than trust a hand-maintained enumeration. The
change is measurable but smaller than an earlier revision of this paragraph claimed, and the
overstatement is corrected here rather than quietly dropped: the round reviewing the second pass
spent six of fifteen findings on provenance and anchor questions; the round reviewing the third pass,
with a real two-commit diff, spent **two of twelve — both on the same deferred `stub_step.ail`
comment range**, not zero. Narrowed to *provenance* alone the improvement is real and clean, one of
fifteen against none. Anchor precision is a separate problem that a diff does not solve, and this
document has now shipped anchor errors in five consecutive passes, twice in the note whose only
purpose is to record an exact deferred-edit range, and once in an edit whose only purpose was fixing
an anchor. The sixth pass shipped none, which is the first time.

**The review count in this block is derived, not written.** It has been stale twice — each time
because a correction was computed against the commit being *answered* rather than the commit being
*written*, and the second time with the first round's action text ("recount at the commit being
written") in front of the author. A third prose resolution would be worth nothing. The count is
`(number of ## Review Comments sections) − 5`, evaluated at the commit that carries the edit, and the
implementation plan should make that a documentation check rather than a habit.

**There is no separate `## Spike-findings disposition (F1–F6)` section, and there was never meant to
be one.** An earlier draft of this Status block and of
`HANDOFF-review-adr-001-f1-f6-revision.md` both referred to one; two of the three verifications
correctly reported it absent. The reference was the error, not the omission: **the normative body is
the disposition record.** Each of F1–F6 is answered where the decision it affects lives — F1 and F2
in D1, F3 and F4 in D4, F5 in D6, F6 in D1 and Implementation Handoff item 2 — and each says in the
decision's own voice what changed and why, including where an earlier revision was wrong. A separate
defendant's summary written after three verdicts would be a reconstruction, not a record. The
handoff has been corrected to match.

Grounded at: `7b9b4a4c266b229be85de5c09342f2b654c89fe7`, **partially re-grounded at
`99749c7d` on 2026-08-01 (two passes).** Both prior reviews certified that
`git diff --stat 7b9b4a4c..HEAD -- src packages scripts Makefile .github` was empty, so every anchor
was evaluable at the grounding revision. **That is no longer true**: `89a1d67` (WI-C13c) changed
`src/core/session.ail` (93 lines) and `src/core/test/stub_step.ail` (37).

The first re-grounding pass corrected two Context rows and claimed "the rest verified unchanged."
**That claim was false and is retracted**: all three verifications independently found a third stale
row (`stub_step.ail`, provider chunk ordering), and two of them found an arithmetic error introduced
*by* the correction pass itself. Three rows anchoring into the two changed files are now corrected
and marked re-grounded; rows in files untouched since `7b9b4a4c` were spot-checked by all three
reviewers and hold. The lesson is recorded rather than paraphrased: **a "re-grounded" label is a
claim to re-verify, not a warrant.** A fresh reviewer must re-verify anchors rather than inherit
them, including these.
Upstream rechecked at: AILANG v0.31.0 release commit `1f6f7dd28`; upstream request filed as
[`sunholo-data/ailang#546`](https://github.com/sunholo-data/ailang/issues/546) and reviewed
2026-07-31 — see *Upstream recorded-stream API status* below.

Depends on:
- `../007_dst_consolidation/ADR-001-motoko-dst-definition-and-taxonomy.md` after review disposition
  and acceptance. That ADR owns the definition, scope, and naming gate.
  **Satisfied 2026-07-26** — 007 is Accepted. This ADR's remaining prerequisite is its own and is
  external: the upstream recorded-stream API in a released binary. The independent review this line
  used to name has been supplied — see the scoped architecture-acceptance review below — and the
  self-regenerating "latest pass unverified" framing is retired (Status).

Amends:
- The implementation architecture in
  `../001_DST/ADR-001-deterministic-simulation-testing-architecture.md`. Its production-code,
  explicit-fake, normalized-trace, stable-scenario, and invariant decisions remain in force. This
  ADR replaces the assumption that scripted model results plus normalized traces are a sufficient
  simulated environment.
- `../004_phase_core_refactor/ADR-001-phase-oriented-core.md` for the generated DST axis. Its pure
  `decide`, production phase/state transitions, driver-owned effect execution, append-only ledger,
  and extension-resident policy decisions remain in force. This ADR replaces function-valued ports
  as the complete deterministic-state mechanism, requires returned-trace/emission parity, and
  disallows that ADR's residual raw-effect allowances inside a D5-conformant simulation profile.
  It additionally **replaces 004's stream-delta ledger-append handle** — the mechanism by which a
  streaming callback was to append deltas to the ledger as they arrived. That resolution is not
  merely superseded, it is unbuildable: the provider callback returns unit and its effect row is
  closed, so it cannot append, accumulate, or tee, which is the finding the spike in `spike/`
  established and the reason for the upstream request. D1's returned ordered emission log replaces
  it — the driver appends the log after the call returns, in arrival order, before the final
  response transition. **004's Phase-B byte-parity test for the
  `thinking_stream_start → N×delta → thinking_stream_end` sequence is retained and relocated to
  that returned-log path.** The ordering and payload it protects is a live TUI contract, not an
  internal detail, and moving where deltas come from must not change what the TUI receives.

Relates to:
- `../005_harness_policy_boundary/ADR-001-harness-policy-boundary.md` — extension-resident policy
  remains extension-resident; this ADR controls the effects through which that policy observes and
  acts on the world.
- `NOTE-scope-and-sequence.md` — project boundary, rollout order, and acceptance gates.
- [`sunholo-data/ailang-world`](https://github.com/sunholo-data/ailang-world) and
  `NOTE-ailang-world-overlap.md` — AILANG World's persistent production effect broker, immutable
  transition history, and replay machinery overlap conceptually with this ADR's effect boundary
  and artifacts. The note records the layer boundary, possible reuse, and terminology risk; AILANG
  World does not replace the seed-driven deterministic test world.

## TL;DR

Motoko earns the name **single-actor, logical-fault DST** by running its real traced session driver
against one explicit, driver-threaded deterministic world. Seeded discovery reacts to the external
requests production code actually makes, chooses modeled outcomes, logical faults, and virtual
latencies, and records the resulting ordered `ExecutionProgram`. Replay consumes that exact
program without invoking the generator. Provider, typed tool, approval, environment, runtime
randomness, conformant extension effects, logical resource state, and time share this boundary;
every system termination returns one complete `LedgerTrace`, and whole-execution invariants decide
the result. The simulator stays sequential and does not model physical faults.

The DST name remains unavailable until the automated conformance gate passes for a named,
fail-closed profile. The checked streaming spike proved that pinned AILANG v0.26.0 cannot both keep
provider chunks immediately visible and return the identical ordered chunks in the immutable
trace: the API rejects both state-returning callbacks and callback-side `SharedMem` capture. Before
this ADR can be accepted, an upstream recorded-stream API must land and pass the spike's direct
integration probe. Rechecks at v0.30.0 (2026-07-24) and v0.31.0 (2026-07-31) both preserve the same
callback and result contract, so upgrading does not by itself remove this blocker.

**What changed on 2026-07-31 is the character of that blocker, not its existence.** Upstream
reviewed `ailang#546`, reproduced the constraint first-party, and recommended adopting this
project's reference implementation with its `{chunks, outcome}` shape intact. The design question
is therefore settled and the remaining gate is a release event. Two consequences follow and are
carried in the decisions below: the API's *shape* may now be designed against, and — separately, and
independently of upstream — a vertical spike through the real driver established that adopting that
API changes nothing observable until Motoko widens its own `Ports.model_step`, because the chunks
are discarded one layer above `std/ai` (D1, F2).

## Context

Motoko already has valuable deterministic testing infrastructure:

- fixed scenario families and seeded parameter generation;
- a real phase-oriented session driver;
- `Scripted([ScriptedStep])` model results;
- a function-valued `Ports` record containing model, approval, clock, environment, tool, and
  extension-runtime functions;
- `ScriptedPortsState` helpers for model results, approvals, and clock values;
- a typed `LedgerTrace` and a traced session entry point; and
- invariant-oriented CI gates.

That is strong scenario testing and property-based testing, but it is not yet a deterministic
simulation environment. The pieces do not form one authoritative world:

- `ScriptedStep` is a successful model-result record, not an execution event or fault sum type.
- The seed chooses scalar parameters; it does not generate the ordering of external events.
- `Ports` is projected into some extension paths, but the main session still performs important
  effects directly. Approval uses `readLine`, session timing uses `std/clock.now`, and native tool
  execution does not uniformly consume `Ports.tool_exec`.
- The function-valued `Ports` shape has no explicit state transition. `Scripted` works because the
  driver threads the provider tail, while `scripted_ports_from_steps` derives an index from message
  history. Neither mechanism can safely consume one ordered program across provider, tool,
  approval, environment, and clock requests.
- `Ports.hooks_runtime` has no production consumer, and several effectful extensions do not use
  `ExtCtx.ports`: MCP, scratchpad, compose, context-mode, and similar hooks can perform
  `Process`/`Net`/`FS`/`SharedMem` effects directly. “Ported core” therefore does not imply a
  hermetic extension profile.
- The clock fixture supplies values but does not advance session-wide time or control a real
  deadline, retry, or timeout. The pinned toolchain supplies no virtual clock to fall back on:
  `--virtual-time` prints a status banner, after which `std/clock.now` still returns real wall-clock
  epoch and `std/clock.sleep` still blocks for real time. Session-wide time must therefore be
  modeled entirely in explicit world state (D4).
- Provider streaming is push-based: `stepWithStream` invokes a callback returning `()`. The current
  compatibility wrapper explicitly leaves its returned `chunks` empty because it cannot accumulate
  callback values without a reference. Live chunks can therefore be projected immediately, but
  current Motoko code has no lossless, run-scoped way to return those same chunks in `LedgerTrace`.
  The project-009 spike confirms that this is an upstream API constraint, not merely a missing
  Motoko helper. AILANG v0.30.0 retains the same closed `{IO}` callback and final
  `Result[StepResult, AIError]`, with no recorded-stream result or API.
- The ordinary scripted entry point returns messages, while the traced entry point must be chosen
  separately;
- some error returns have no terminal summary, and emitted summaries are not guaranteed to be part
  of the returned `LedgerTrace`; and
- a seed can replay the current generator only while its mapping remains unchanged. There is no
  authoritative, versioned execution program to replay.

Extending `ScriptedStep` alone cannot close these gaps. Model outcomes, tools, approvals, time,
terminal tracing, replay, and the declared extension profile must share one architecture.

**Known stale source comment — resolved 2026-08-02 by WI-A2 (P5).** `src/core/test/stub_step.ail`
carried a comment describing a `dispatch_step` signature that `89a1d67` had deleted: it promised that
the function "Returns both the step result and the updated provider (tail of script for `Scripted`)",
that "Loop callers thread `next_provider`", and that "rt is forwarded to `tools_with_extensions`" —
`rt` having been a real parameter before `89a1d67` and not one after. The same block then contradicted
itself a few lines down ("There is no `next_provider` to return").

WI-A2 rewrote that region, so the stale lines are gone and the surviving comment describes the current
contract: provider state in, its successor out, alongside the emission log and the outcome. Nothing
here is outstanding; the paragraph is kept because the finding is what motivated P5's anchor
re-grounding, and because the failure mode — a comment that outlived two signature changes and was
still being cited by an ADR — is worth leaving on the record.

Recorded here rather than silently repaired, because moving source under this ADR is the specific
pattern that produced the stale anchors above. **This note has now been wrong twice**, which is its own
argument for the deferral discipline: the first revision cited `170-171`/`189-190`, which would have
deleted a correct line and left a stale one; the second cited `171-172`, which would have left `:173`.
Both were caught by review, neither by the authoring side.

## Decision

### D1. Use a driver-owned, state-threaded execution-world protocol

Motoko will have one semantic boundary for external observations that can affect session control
flow or the ledger. The boundary is a state transition, conceptually:

```text
handle(world_state, world_request)
  -> Result({
       intermediate_emissions[],
       response,
       next_world_state,
       observations
     }, HarnessError)
```

The real session driver owns and threads `world_state` alongside its existing loop state. Every
request returns the next state explicitly, including error outcomes. The implementation must not
hide the program cursor or clock in `SharedMem`, process-global mutation, an ambient RNG, or a
mutable test singleton: those would reintroduce order dependence and make parallel test processes
unsafe. The clock is no exception and gets no exemption: per D4 the explicit value in `world_state`
is the only clock, and no runtime clock participates in a deterministic run.

**`world_state` owns every replay and generator cursor, and it is the only owner.** An earlier
revision of this decision listed only the hiding places above, which left an already-threaded cursor
unaddressed — and Motoko has one: `StepProvider` carries the remaining `Scripted` script in its ADT
payload. Both available arrangements satisfy the letter of "returns the next state explicitly", and
the vertical spike proved they are not equivalent. Placing the provider inside the world adapter —
`LiveWorld(StepProvider)`, the natural reading of *"a live world delegates requests to evolved
production adapters"* below — type-checked, kept the type-check gate fully green, and silently
failed 6 of 18 scenarios by freezing the script cursor so every step replayed step 0. The
implementation plan therefore retires `C2LoopState.provider` rather than leaving two homes for the
same fact.

**"The only owner" is the end-state invariant, and the interim home is named rather than left to an
implementer.** `world_state` does not exist yet, while the F6 cursor defect is live today and is
sequenced ahead of it (Implementation Handoff item 2). Between now and the migration the scripted
cursor lives in **one explicit field on `C2LoopState`, threaded by the driver** — not in a
closure captured inside a `Ports` value, not in a provider ADT payload, and not re-derived from
message history. That interim field is subsumed by `world_state` when it lands and is deleted in the
same change. The prohibition that matters throughout is the one this decision opens with: exactly one
home, visibly threaded. An interim explicit field satisfies it; a second closure-captured cursor
alongside `world_state` would not.

**Naming the home is not enough, because no mechanism currently reaches it.** An earlier revision
stopped at the field and pointed at Implementation Handoff item 1 for the mechanism, which does not
supply one: item 1 widens `model_step`'s *result* with an emission log, and a successor cursor is not
an emission. `Ports.model_step` takes no state parameter (`src/core/ports.ail:18`), so a returned
cursor has no way back in on the next call, while returning a successor `Ports` puts the cursor in
that value's closure — the arrangement this decision prohibits by name. The already-tested state
machine has the shape the port lacks at both ends:
`scripted_model_next(state) -> {result, next}` (`src/core/test/scripted_ports.ail:38-48`).

**The interim provider operation therefore takes the current provider state and returns its
successor, alongside `emissions` and the outcome.** The sole persistent copy is the named
`C2LoopState` field. This is a **second widening of `Ports.model_step`, on a second and separately
stated ground** — state threading, not discarded emissions — and unlike the first it is **not
behaviour-preserving**, because it changes the port's input shape and every construction site's
contract. The two must be planned and reviewed as distinct changes even though they touch one field;
Implementation Handoff items 1 and 2 are marked accordingly. The loss-channel scoping rule below
governs the *emission* widening and does not reach this one, which is grounded here instead.

**Three mechanical facts constrain that widening, and each was found by review rather than by
design.**

*The state type must be concrete and declared at or below `src/core/ports.ail`.* The interim state is
a named `ProviderState` in `ports.ail`, not the existing `ScriptedPortsState`. That type
(`src/core/test/scripted_ports.ail:20-24`) carries `ScriptedStep`, declared in
`src/core/test/stub_step.ail:34`, and `scripted_ports.ail` imports `ports`, `stub_step`, **and**
`session` — so neither module that must declare the widened field nor the driver that must hold the
`C2LoopState` field can import it without closing a cycle, which AILANG rejects (`LDR002`). The
generic escape does not exist either: parameterising `Ports` over its state type is accepted as a
declaration but its instantiation fails unification on the pinned compiler, and no parameterised
record type appears anywhere in the tree. **`ScriptedPortsState`/`scripted_model_next` are therefore a
design precedent, not reusable code**, and making the real thing requires relocating `ScriptedStep` to
`ports.ail` or below — a source move that must be budgeted in the plan, not discovered inside it.

*The live and caller-supplied adapters return their input state unchanged.* `live_ports` is stateless.
The identity transition is the specified answer, not an implementation detail left to six construction
sites. `ported_provider` (`src/core/session.ail:695-701`) returns the initial state alongside the
`Ports` — a pair, or a paired constructor — with the empty `ProviderState` for the `LiveAI` and
`Ported` arms and the script-derived one for `Scripted`. Only successors replace it thereafter.

*The extension model path cannot carry the token, and is excluded rather than hand-waved.* There are
**two** calls through `Ports.model_step`, not one: `src/core/test/stub_step.ail:198` in `dispatch_step`,
and `src/core/session.ail:662` inside `ext_ai_step`, which `ext_ports_of` (`:668-677`) wraps as
`ExtPorts.ai_step` and hands to four hook contexts. That ABI returns `Result[string, string]`
(`packages/motoko-ext-abi/types.ail:63`) and the hook results above it are decision-only, so a
successor has no way back to `C2LoopState`. Discarding it at `:662` recreates F6 exactly; capturing it
in the closure creates the second home this decision prohibits. **The interim seam therefore covers
the main loop only, and extension-issued model calls are excluded from every conformant profile until
the world-token ABI D5 already requires has landed.** Two consequences follow and neither is
cosmetic: **Implementation Handoff item 2 is a partial cursor fix and says so**, and **an extension
that calls `ExtPorts.ai_step` must have every hook it registers explicitly excluded in any conformant
interim profile — every hook it registers, not only the ones reaching the call.**

**That is a coverage cost, not a conformance disqualification, and an earlier revision of this
paragraph got it wrong.** It said such a profile was "not conformance-eligible", which is stronger
than D5 licenses: D5's machinery already handles this case correctly — an explicitly excluded hook is
not covered, is named in the result, and causes a fail-closed `HarnessFailure` if dispatch reaches it
— and the acceptance table lists excluded hooks as evidence a profile *passes*. A profile installing
an `ai_step`-calling extension is permitted only if the extension is **omitted** from the install list;
excluding its hooks does not work, because six of the eight are dispatched unconditionally and reaching
an exclusion fails closed (D5). A profile that omits it is conformant and honest; it simply
does not cover those hooks, and any run that reaches one fails closed rather than silently discarding
a cursor.

Two things follow, and the second is the one with teeth:

- **The conformance obligation is on the profile definition, not on the extension.** Installing an
  `ai_step`-calling extension is permitted. Installing one **without excluding every hook it
  registers** is a **profile-definition rejection**, because an un-excluded path discards provider
  state with no fail-closed signal.

  **The predicate is "the extension *calls* a classifier-2 field on an `ExtPorts`-typed value", at
  extension granularity.** It is deliberately coarser than the hooks that actually reach the port —
  an earlier revision said "every hook that *can reach* the port", a call-graph property with no
  instrument, and establishing that `compaction_ai`'s single reaching hook is `on_pre_step` took a
  four-edge manual walk through two modules. An ADR that requires inspection where it has just built
  an artifact to avoid it (clause 3, D4) is specifying a checklist.

  **"Call site", not "textual occurrence", and the difference is not pedantry — it decides whether
  the ADR's own interim profile is buildable.** An earlier revision said "textual reference" and
  claimed decidability from a grep. Run that grep and it selects five packages: `motoko-ext-abi`,
  `motoko-ext-compaction-ai`, `motoko_ext_conformance`, **and both `motoko-ext-empty-stop-guard` and
  `motoko-ext-progress-contract-guard`** — the pair named below as the first useful interim profile.
  The guards match on their own unit scaffolding: a `noop_ai_step` stub and an `ai_step:` field
  construction. Under the textual reading, installing either guard excludes all eight of its hooks,
  including the one its entire behaviour lives in, and the interim profile is inert or rejected.
  Restricting to call sites gives exactly two — `packages/motoko-ext-compaction-ai/compaction_ai.ail:106`
  and `packages/motoko_ext_conformance/fixtures/reject_fixtures.ail:90`. **An earlier revision
  asserted those two as "the only two `ai_step` references", which was false as written**: it counted
  calls and said references, and then a rule was built on the word rather than the count.

  Out of scope for the matcher, by name: field *declarations* in the ABI type, record *construction*
  (`ai_step: noop_ai_step`), occurrences in strings or comments, and the `motoko-ext-abi` package
  itself, which declares the field rather than calling it. In scope: any package the registry can
  install. `motoko_ext_conformance` is not registrable — it does not appear in
  `src/core/ext/registry_generated.ail` — so it cannot reach a profile through installation; if a
  profile ever installs a fixture package deliberately, the rule applies to it unchanged.

  **The matcher is a typed-call inventory, and `grep -rn '\.ai_step('` is its conservative
  approximation rather than its definition.** The approximation is wrong in both directions and both
  are stated rather than left to be found: it matches `.ai_step(` on a *non*-`ExtPorts` record, which
  over-selects and fails closed; and it misses a call reached through a local alias, a wrapper, a
  re-export, a computed field access, or a newline before the paren, which under-selects and fails
  **open**. The sound form is a parsed, type-aware field-call inventory — `ailang iface` already
  exposes parsed signatures on the pin — or a two-stage scan that inventories every occurrence of the
  field name, strips declarations, constructions, strings and comments, resolves the receiver's type,
  and **fails closed on every occurrence it cannot resolve**. The grep alone is not a gate; it is what
  a reader can run today to see that the current answer is two call sites. If per-hook granularity is
  wanted later, the refinement path is to extend D4's site-to-hook attribution table to extension
  packages — and per D5's closed-ABI note below, that is
  the **only** available refinement, because `register.ail` can never narrow the hook set.

  **One predicate, at six sites.** The Status block, this paragraph, D5's exclusion paragraph, D5's
  validation bullet, the acceptance row, and Implementation Handoff item 2 all state it. **That count
  is a claim to check, not a warrant** — the sixth pass asserted "stated once" and was stale at two
  sites, the seventh asserted "six sites, same words" and was stale at three, one of which stated the
  retired rule *normatively* in D5. Both times the assertion was made in the same edit that was
  supposed to have propagated it. The implementation plan owns a documentation check, and it needs an
  exact target to be buildable: **a canonical predicate sentence, plus an explicit list of the
  normative anchors that must contain it**, failing when an anchor's text drifts or a normative
  statement appears outside the list. Grepping a phrase with no fixed wording and no fixed anchor set
  — which is all the last two passes offered — enforces nothing. Earlier revisions phrased it five
  different ways — "can reach the port", "reaches a
  non-world-mediated seam", "references a field", "reaching a field from an un-excluded hook", and
  bare "textual reference". Two were actively harmful: the *seam* phrasing, read literally at HEAD
  where nothing is routed, rejects every extension-installing profile; and *textual reference*
  rejects both guards of the ADR's own interim profile. The rule is **calls a classifier-2 field on
  an `ExtPorts`-typed value**, at extension granularity. The sixth pass claimed this was "stated
  once" and it was stale at two sites. **The claim here is narrower and checkable: six normative sites,
  substantively aligned, not word-identical** — the six use six formulations, and asserting otherwise
  is the mistake this paragraph exists to stop repeating.

  **Amendment, 2026-08-03 (WI-A11 implemented). "Six normative sites" was a count without an
  enumeration, and the check this clause asks for cannot be built against one.** A11's brief is an
  anchor-set drift check that fails when an anchor's text changes without a re-accepted hash **or
  when a normative statement of the predicate appears outside the six**. That second half is
  unenforceable while "the six" names no locations: two different readings of this ADR each produce a
  defensible six — one taking Status plus the four D1/D5 rule statements plus the predicate
  definition, another taking Status, D1, the acceptance row and the implementation handoff — and a
  check built on either would have been asserting a curation, not verifying one. Twelve passages in
  the normative region mentioned the rule when A11 measured it — thirteen once this amendment's own
  table row below is counted — so the gap between "a dozen mentions" and "six sites" was doing real
  work that nobody had written down.

  **The six are hereby enumerated, and the enumeration is the normative artifact — not the count.**
  They are the passages that state the obligation as a rule binding on a profile definition:

  | # | Section | States |
  |---|---|---|
  | 1 | Status | the rule and its profile-definition rejection |
  | 2 | D1, handoff-item-2 correction | *every* hook it registers, not only those reaching the call |
  | 3 | D1, conformance obligation | installing without excluding is a profile-definition rejection |
  | 4 | D1, predicate definition | "calls a classifier-2 field on an `ExtPorts`-typed value" |
  | 5 | D5, profile validity | installing while any hook is un-excluded is invalid |
  | 6 | D5, routing audit | the classifier-2 condition the audit checks |

  The remaining mentions **apply or discuss** the rule rather than stating it — this paragraph and
  its table, the omission-versus-exclusion consequence, D3's no-instrument note, the acceptance
  table's evidence row, and the Consequences and handoff discussions. That split is a judgement, so
  it is recorded the way clause 3's attributions are: **per passage, with a named reviewer**, in
  `tools/predicate-anchors/anchors.json`, and `make predicate_anchors` fails closed on any mention it
  cannot match to a recorded classification. A thirteenth-plus mention appearing later is a triage
  event, not a silent pass.

  **Why the check is drift and not containment**, restated because it is easy to get backwards: this
  paragraph says the six are deliberately *not* word-identical, so a check requiring one canonical
  sentence at all six is red on the unmutated ADR **by construction**. Canonicalising them is six
  amendments this project does not budget, and would destroy the information each formulation
  carries. The check therefore hashes each passage as it stands and fails when one changes without a
  re-accepted hash.
- **The practical consequence is about utility, not eligibility.** `compaction_ai` calls
  `ctx.ports.ai_step` (`packages/motoko-ext-compaction-ai/compaction_ai.ail:106`) and appears in the
  extension order of **all fourteen** checked-in configurations. Every one of them can be made
  conformant by excluding `compaction_ai`'s hooks — it registers **eight**, of which `on_pre_step` is
  the only non-trivial one and the only one reaching the port, the other seven being
  constant-returning lambdas — but excluding them does not yield a runnable profile, because
  `on_build_system_prompt`, `on_budget_plan`, `on_pre_step` and `on_tool_policy` are dispatched
  unconditionally (D5). The conformant move is to omit `compaction_ai` from the install list. The
  first *useful* interim
  profile is therefore a purpose-built narrow one rather than a shipped configuration. **D5 retires
  the "pure guards and deterministic fixture hooks may form the initial profile" formulation** as
  naming two classes with no available member: that profile is the real driver plus the main-loop
  cursor, covering no extension behaviour. The interim milestone must not be planned as though it
  delivers a conformant *and covering* `default`.

Widening `ExtPorts.ai_step` and the hook results to carry the token is the eventual path, it belongs
to the ABI major the repin already forces (*Consequences*), and it must not be smuggled into the
interim step. This exclusion is consistent with D5's own coverage criterion rather than an exception
to it: D5 admits an effectful hook only when it is "effectful only through D1 world-mediated ports,
with explicit world state returned to the host", and `ai_step` returns none.

**Deriving a replay position from mutable message history is prohibited by name.** It is not merely
one more hiding place; it is the arrangement that currently executes, and compaction mutates the
history it reads. The only scripted provider the DST actually runs
(`scripted_ports_from_steps`) re-derives its index from `assistant_count` on every call, while both
implementations that thread a cursor explicitly are disconnected from the driver. Under a folding
compactor that derived index **pins** rather than rewinds: the payload's assistant count stops at the
compaction floor while real history keeps growing, the same step is served forever, and the run dies
of budget exhaustion in a way indistinguishable from an ordinary result. That is a confirmed defect
in the harness today (F6), and it is the concrete reason this sentence is normative rather than
stylistic. D2's seeded generation of longer programs is what makes it reachable.

A request may yield ordered intermediate emissions before its final response. Provider stream
chunks are the current case. The provider exchange result must contain a lossless ordered emission
log as well as the final `StepResult`/`AIError`. A live adapter also projects each chunk to the UI
at arrival; after the call returns, the driver appends the adapter's identical emission log to the
authoritative `LedgerTrace` in arrival order before it applies the final response transition. A
deterministic adapter supplies timed emissions from the program, and the driver projects and
appends each at its virtual arrival point. The two paths must produce the same event ordering and
content without double-projecting live chunks.

This requirement is a blocking substrate gate, not an implementation detail. The checked spike in
`spike/` dispositions the two candidate representations against pinned AILANG v0.26.0:

1. A modeled provider result that preserves immediate projection and returns the ordered chunks
   passes success and partial-stream-then-error parity under `--caps IO`, but the real API exposes
   no such result.
2. A CAS-claimed, request-scoped `SharedMem` recorder passes success, partial-error,
   collision/cleanup, interleaved-scope, and eight-process isolation probes, but the real
   `stepWithStream` callback's closed `{IO}` row rejects `SharedMem`.
3. The real API's IO-only positive control streams `ContentDelta` and `Usage` and returns a final
   result, while a state-returning callback fails type unification against `()`.

The 2026-07-24 latest-upstream recheck does not change that disposition. The configured AILANG MCP
reported v0.30.0 as latest. An empty diff between the v0.26.0 and v0.30.0 `stepWithStream`
signatures confirmed that v0.30.0 still requires a unit-returning, closed `{IO}` callback and still
returns only `Result[StepResult, AIError]`. A full-source search found no recorded-stream variant.
The checksum-verified v0.30.0 compiler reproduced both intended failures: the state-returning
callback fails `()` versus list unification, and the recorder callback fails closed-row unification
because of `SharedMem`. The official v0.30.0 IO-only streaming example checks and runs with
`--ai-stub`, so these failures are specific to capture rather than evidence that streaming itself
was removed.

Therefore the selected prerequisite is an evolved upstream provider/runtime API that preserves
immediate callbacks and returns the lossless ordered observed chunks with the final result. A
row-polymorphic callback plus scoped recorder is not the default fallback: it adds `SharedMem` to
the deterministic profile and weakens capability-based hermeticity, so selecting it would require
an explicit amendment. A process-global, unscoped, or silently colliding recorder remains rejected.
Delaying all chunk projection until provider completion also remains rejected because it changes
current live UX semantics.

**Before streaming trace parity can be claimed — and therefore before the DST name is earned** — the
upstream recorded-stream API must be pinned and a direct positive version of the spike must prove
immediate projection, exact returned-log parity, success, partial-stream-then-error, and no duplicate
delivery. Earlier revisions made this a blocker on *accepting this ADR*; the scoped
architecture-acceptance review ruled otherwise and the Status block records the split. The
architecture does not depend on that API existing; the parity claim does.

**That gate blocks streaming trace parity. It does not block the port widening, and an earlier
revision of this clause wrongly implied that it did** by adding "and production migration must not
begin" without qualification. A planner reading D1 top to bottom sequenced: wait for upstream →
adopt the new API → replace `Ports` later. That ordering is a trap. `Ports.model_step` returns
`Result[StepResult, AIError]`, which structurally cannot carry an emission log, and
`ported_provider` funnels **every** provider through it before the loop starts — so adopting the
upstream API without widening the port first changes nothing observable, and guarantees an empty
emission log through the adoption step and most of the migration. The widening has no upstream
dependency: the field can be widened today with `emissions: []` at every construction site, and the
change is independently testable against `Scripted` providers with no provider access at all.

The ordering rule is: **widen the port before adopting whatever fills it**, since the port is where
the information is thrown away. **The rule is scoped to ports with a demonstrated loss channel, and
today that is exactly one field.** An earlier revision justified it as general "because every `Ports`
field is a lossy crossing of the same kind." That is not established. `model_step` takes a multi-fire
`(StreamChunk) -> () ! {IO}` callback whose values the returning closure discards
(`src/core/test/stub_step.ail:148-154`) while returning only `Result[StepResult, AIError]` — a
concrete, demonstrated loss. `approval_read` is a synchronous `ApprovalRequest -> ApprovalResolution`
and `clock_now` is a point read `() -> int`; neither has an intermediate channel through which a
value could be silently dropped, and this decision's own bullets below preserve both result types
unchanged. Generalizing to them would mandate widenings this ADR neither names nor justifies. The
stringly `tool_exec` also needs widening, but for a separately named reason — a typed
`ToolCallEnvelope` and deadline contract, below — not because of a discarded emission channel.
Extending the rule to a further field requires identifying that field's loss channel and its richer
producer contract first.

**A widening may also be required on a ground this rule does not cover, and one is.** `model_step`
is widened twice: once by this rule, for its discarded emission log; and once for interim provider
state threading, on the ground stated above under cursor ownership. The second is not a loss-channel
case and is not licensed by this paragraph. Where the two are confused, the emission widening looks
sufficient for the F6 fix, which it is not.

Doing the provider case first shrinks the upstream dependency's blast radius to a
single closure in `live_ports`, which is the strongest de-risking available on this gate. What
remains blocked until the API lands is the content of that one closure and the parity proof that
depends on it — not the migration.

`world_state` is more than a cursor. It contains the virtual clock, generator/replay state,
synthetic environment and runtime-random stream, and any logical resource state promised by the
selected profile—for example an in-memory file map, tool/MCP availability, or approval-channel
state. A profile may treat an opaque external tool as a scripted typed boundary instead of
emulating its internals, but must say so; it may not imply filesystem/server semantics it does not
model.

The authoritative request surface covers:

1. provider requests and streaming, tagged by origin (main loop or extension);
2. native and delegated tool execution as a typed request/result contract;
3. approval input;
4. environment/config reads performed during the established run;
5. runtime randomness, if any;
6. monotonic time and time-bearing completion/deadline decisions; and
7. conformant extension-side external effects (D5).

The existing `src/core/ports.ail` record is the migration root and live-adapter vocabulary, but its
function-valued shape is not itself the final world protocol. In particular:

- the provider exchange wraps the existing typed `Result[StepResult, AIError]` with its ordered
  intermediate-emission log. **The site is `Ports.model_step`**, named here as concretely as
  `tool_exec` is named below, because this is an edit to a record that exists today and not only a
  property of the future world protocol. The emission log is a property of the **port**; the
  upstream API and the world protocol are both consumers of it;
- the tool contract must carry a typed `ToolCallEnvelope`, timeout/deadline information, and a typed
  result/error rather than `tool_exec(string, string) -> string`;
- approval remains a typed `ApprovalResolution`; and
- clock reads return the current world time without advancing it.

The world ends at the external result boundary. Production code still validates and interprets
`StepResult`/`AIError`, correlates tool-call ids, converts typed tool outcomes into history
messages, applies approval/policy decisions, updates budgets, and records ledger events. Moving
those operations into the simulator would violate D5.

The unused `Ports.hooks_runtime` callback is not a world-state carrier. The implementation plan
must either give it a separate demonstrated production purpose or remove/deprecate it; hiding the
simulator behind that callback is rejected.

A live world delegates requests to evolved production adapters. A deterministic world interprets
the recorded program. The driver uses the same request/response types and transition code in both
cases; production state-machine and policy code does not branch on “test mode.” A small adapter
dispatch between `LiveWorld` and `DeterministicWorld` is mechanism, analogous to the current
`StepProvider`, not a second behavior implementation.

An effect is required to cross this boundary when changing its result could change:

- the next state-machine decision;
- messages or tool results appended to history;
- a ledger record;
- retry/finalization behavior;
- budget or timeout behavior; or
- the terminal outcome.

Diagnostic output that cannot influence execution may remain outside the modeled world, but it must
not be used as the only copy of an invariant-bearing fact. The deterministic executor accumulates
its result, trace, and diagnostics first; a wrapper may print them afterward. A live projection
sink may mirror events during production, while the deterministic profile uses a collecting/no-op
sink so reporting `IO` does not justify ambient input during execution.

### D2. Discovery is seed-driven; replay consumes a resolved execution program

Precomputing exact expected requests would require duplicating the session logic to predict them.
Motoko therefore separates **discovery** from **replay**.

During discovery, a deterministic seeded world receives each real D1 request as the production
driver makes it. A schema-versioned generator chooses a compatible response, fault, and latency
from that request plus explicit generator state. The choice changes the next production state and
therefore which request arrives next. The world records every actual request projection and chosen
outcome into a resolved `ExecutionProgram`.

Replay receives that resolved program and never calls the generator:

```text
DiscoveryConfig {
  schema_version
  generator_id
  generator_version
  seed
  initial_world {
    messages_and_policy
    synthetic_environment
    clock_epoch
    extension_profile
  }
}

ExecutionProgram {
  schema_version
  generator_id
  generator_version
  seed
  initial_world
  execution_manifest        -- or a named sidecar the validator requires
  interactions[]
}

Interaction =
    ExpectProvider(origin, request_matcher, timed_outcome)
  | ExpectTool(origin, request_matcher, deadline, timed_outcome)
  | ExpectApproval(request_matcher, deadline, timed_outcome)
  | ExpectExtensionEffect(origin, request_matcher, deadline, timed_outcome)
  | EnvironmentRead(key, value_or_missing)
  | RuntimeRandomDraw(bounds, value)
  | AdvanceClock(delta)
```

`ExpectExtensionEffect` closes what would otherwise be a hole: D1 puts conformant extension-side
external effects on the authoritative request surface, D3 requires the corresponding
provider/tool/process failure for an effectful hook, and D5 admits such hooks only through
world-mediated ports — but a program with no interaction for them could record neither the request
nor its outcome, so the class would be unreplayable. Its `origin` is the extension id, and its
class id is the same stable identifier D3's catalogue and D11's coverage counters use, so a
process-failure class cannot be counted as reached under one name and mapped under another. An
implementation may instead represent extension `proc_exec` as `ExpectTool`, but only by stating that
normatively and giving the conversion and identity rules; leaving the choice implicit is not
permitted.

The exact AILANG type names are plan-level, but these semantics are architectural:

- Discovery chooses only at requests the real driver actually makes. It never invents a tool,
  approval, or extension-effect request disconnected from production control flow. A generated
  provider outcome may contain a tool call and thereby cause a later production tool request; the
  seed controls the resulting trajectory without a test copy of the state machine.
- Each discovery choice is a deterministic function of generator id/version, seed, generator
  state, the bounded request projection, and current world state. No ambient RNG participates.
- The resolved interactions are an ordered expected protocol, not anonymous response queues. Each
  records (a) a stable causal identity used to decide whether the outcome can be delivered and
  (b) a bounded full request projection/digest used for strict reproduction and invariants.
  Every interaction identity includes a global encounter ordinal. Provider identity additionally
  includes kind, origin, step, and model; extension-effect identity additionally includes kind,
  origin (the extension id), the effect class id, and call id where the effect has one; tool and
  approval identity additionally includes kind,
  origin, call id, and name. The ordinal keeps repeated production call ids representable so an
  invariant can reject them as system behavior rather than the program decoder rejecting the
  artifact. Arguments and message/payload digests are recorded projections, not silently
  discarded.
- Replay has two explicit modes. **Strict replay** (the reproduction contract) requires causal
  identity and recorded projections to match under the recorded execution manifest/profile.
  **Regression replay** on a newer revision requires compatible causal identity, records
  projection differences, and may continue so the same environment outcomes exercise changed
  production logic. A wrong kind/origin, unsafe identity mismatch, exhausted program, or unused
  interaction is a
  `HarnessFailure`, not a simulated system fault. Regression replay never weakens tool-call/result
  correlation or delivers an outcome to a different logical request.
- `timed_outcome` carries deterministic latency or completion time. Before delivery, the world
  advances its monotonic clock by the recorded non-negative amount. Explicit `AdvanceClock`
  interactions model time between response-bearing requests. Clock reads return the current value
  and do not independently advance it.
- A provider timed outcome may contain ordered stream chunks with non-decreasing virtual offsets
  followed by a final `StepResult` or `AIError`. The driver records each chunk at its offset before
  the final response. Chunk callbacks remain serial within the provider request; they do not become
  independent actors under this ADR.
- Environment reads and runtime random draws are also recorded in encounter order. Discovery uses
  synthetic environment values and the seeded world; replay returns the recorded values. Unknown
  required keys, incompatible random bounds, or stream exhaustion are harness failures.
- The program contains concrete outcomes and the bounded actual request projections needed to
  diagnose mismatches. The generator id/version and seed explain discovery; the serialized
  resolved program is the authoritative reproduction artifact.
- Program decoding and a pure structural validator run before replay. They reject malformed
  schemas, negative time, duplicate interaction identities, impossible static references, and
  absent required initial values.
- Each generator schema declares hard bounds for interactions, stream chunks, payload bytes,
  logical-resource size, and clock advancement. Exceeding a bound is a generator/harness failure,
  not an unbounded test run.
- The discovery gate reports generator failures and forbidden-effect/harness-failure counts; all
  must be zero. A harness failure deliberately created by a conformance probe is reported
  separately from the search corpus.

Generation may also choose ordinary configuration and message inputs, but scalar input generation
does not count as the trajectory. To satisfy the naming gate, seeded choices at multiple real
effect boundaries must influence ordering, fault placement, and time across the resulting
execution.

### D3. Logical faults are modeled outcomes, not injected internal decisions

Faults enter through the same boundary as successful external outcomes. The state machine and
session driver remain production code and decide how to react.

The minimum catalogue required before adopting the DST name is:

| Boundary | Required fault classes |
|---|---|
| Provider | retryable `AIError`, non-retryable `AIError`, protocol-inconsistent typed result, partial stream followed by error, empty terminal response |
| Tool | typed execution error/non-zero result, protocol-inconsistent result (for example wrong call id), and completion after its declared deadline |
| Approval | explicit denial and no response before a declared approval deadline, where that deadline is enabled by the production policy |
| Conformant extension effect | the corresponding provider/tool/process failure when the selected D5 profile contains an effectful hook using that world request |

**That mapping is a versioned, machine-readable artifact that the gate reads — not prose in an
implementation plan.** One catalogue is the single source of truth, and for every class it carries:
a stable class id; the applicability condition, if the class is conditional; the production result
or error constructor it is delivered as; the **named recovery-branch id** it is intended to reach;
and its logical-state transition. A decorative fault variant that cannot influence the production
session does not satisfy this decision, and "cannot influence" must be decidable by reading the
artifact rather than by inspecting the implementation.

Two of the required classes above are conditional — the approval deadline exists only where
production policy enables it, and the extension-effect class only where the selected profile
contains an effectful hook using that world request. A profile may therefore legitimately not
exercise them. **When it does not, the run report and the D5 profile definition must name each
waived class and the condition that waived it**, so a coverage claim is readable against D3's full
table rather than silently against its applicable subset. An unstated waiver is a coverage claim
this decision does not grant.

Every successful or faulty outcome also defines its logical world transition. Write-like tool
faults specify whether the all-or-nothing logical update occurred; server-drop faults update
availability for subsequent calls; deadline outcomes specify whether work completed before or
after the observation. Torn/partial physical writes remain excluded, but “timeout” cannot leave
the simulator's logical state ambiguous.

**Amendment, 2026-08-02 (WI-A7 implemented; `a7d70b5`). Two required classes have less production
branch behind them than this table implies, and the catalogue records both rather than mapping them
to a placeholder.**

- **The provider protocol-inconsistent class names two forms and only one is reachable.** The
  malformed `ToolCall.arguments` form has a real branch (`tool_dispatch_adapter.tool_call_to_envelope`
  degrades to an empty JSON object and the per-tool argument extraction reports missing fields). The
  inconsistent-`StepResult` form has **none**: `model_phase.phase_from_result` projects a
  `StepResult` into a `ProviderResult` event without validating it, so a result whose
  `finish_reason` disagrees with its `tool_calls`, or which repeats a tool-call id, reaches the loop
  unremarked.
- **The approval-deadline class has no clock-driven branch in production at all.** No policy
  declares an elapsed-time approval deadline. `resolve_approval`'s only no-response branch is
  end-of-input — channel closure, which the code itself labels `"timeout — no approval received"`.
  The class being conditional makes this legitimate rather than a defect, but a profile claiming it
  covers a *timed* deadline would be over-claiming, so the condition is named in the artifact.

**A third class has no reachable branch at all, and the artifact says so.** `ExtPorts.ai_step`
delivers no fault: `session.ext_ai_step` hands the port a fresh empty world, so against a `Scripted`
provider the empty script serves `terminal_step()` and the extension is told the model answered.
That is the concrete reason D1's rule — a conformant interim profile must exclude every hook an
`ai_step`-calling extension registers — currently has no instrument behind it. The catalogue permits
`NoReachableBranch` **only for a conditional class and only with a reason**; an unconditionally
applicable class naming it is a validator rejection, because a decorative fault that cannot influence
the production session does not satisfy this decision.

The injection boundary matters. A malformed `ToolCall.arguments` string or inconsistent
`StepResult` can be delivered through the typed provider boundary and exercises session validation.
A malformed raw HTTP/SSE payload exercises a provider adapter parser, not the session, unless that
adapter is explicitly inside the selected simulation profile. The fault catalogue must not claim
wire-parser coverage from a typed post-parse result.

Timeout is not a freely selected error label for purposes of pillar 5. The deterministic world
derives it from the generated completion time and the production request's deadline. An explicitly
scripted `Timeout` that would occur regardless of clock advancement counts as logical fault
injection, but not as virtual-time evidence.

Directly forcing `StepDecision`, editing ledger state, or bypassing validation is rejected as fault
injection: it would test a second test-only transition system.

The catalogue can grow without a new ADR when additions preserve this boundary. Adding physical
faults or changing the system's durability contract requires revisiting the project scope. That
exclusion is bound to accepted 007 D1.3 and carries its triggers verbatim rather than a looser
paraphrase: **reopen before adding a crash-recovery, fsync, WAL, resume-from-ledger, or
replicated-state correctness contract.** Any one of those five gives Motoko a physical durability
contract it does not have today, and the moment it has one, the physical-fault exclusion stops
being a scope decision and becomes an untested gap.

### D4. One monotonic virtual clock controls all time-bearing behavior

The deterministic world owns a monotonic clock. Session code and conformant extensions read it
through the authoritative boundary; they do not read ambient wall time when the value can affect
behavior or an asserted trace.

**The explicit clock value in `world_state` is the only clock.** No runtime clock participates in a
deterministic run: there is no runtime epoch to record, no mirrored advance, and no conformance
assertion comparing an explicit value against a runtime one. `AdvanceClock(delta)` and the latency
carried by a timed outcome update the explicit value and nothing else.

This is a correction, not a preference. An earlier revision of this decision required deterministic
runs under the pinned runtime's `--virtual-time`, with `AdvanceClock(delta)` driving
`std/clock.sleep(delta)` so that residual direct `std/clock.now` reads would observe the same
virtualized clock during migration. **That mechanism does not exist.** On pinned v0.26.0 the flag
prints a status banner and changes nothing observable:

```text
$ ailang run --virtual-time --caps IO,Clock --entry main vclock.ail
  ⏰ Virtual time enabled
t0=1785301954869 t1=1785301957870 delta=3001
real  0m3.139s
```

`now()` returns real wall-clock epoch, a 3000 ms `sleep` blocks for ~3000 ms of real time, and the
delta varies run to run. The same holds with `--seed`, with `AILANG_SEED`, and on the prototype
toolchain. The evidence previously cited for this row — that the flag parses and the run exits 0 —
established only that the flag is accepted.

**Amendment, 2026-08-04 (WI-A14 implemented; `3dd8a82`). The latency pair this decision requires is
built, and it does NOT need the provider-latency widening the implementation plan had bundled with
it.** The pair needs a class carrying three things — a latency channel, a declared deadline, and a
comparison between them — and the **tool** class has had all three since WI-A12:
`ScriptedTool.duration_ms`, `ToolInvocation.timeout_ms` read through the env class, and
`ports.world_tool`'s guard. `scripts/dst/latency_pair_dst.ail` holds the request and the underlying
completion result constant, changes only `duration_ms` (40 ms and 3000 ms against a 1000 ms
deadline), and demonstrates the differing completion-versus-timeout behaviour with both programs
replaying deterministically.

**The branch is shown TAKEN rather than inferred from the outcome**: both operands of the comparison
are read off the recorded interaction, and a **third world** carries the same 3000 ms latency with
*no declared deadline* and must complete — without which the pair would be measuring duration rather
than lateness. The **provider** class still has none of the three, so widening `ScriptedStep` closes
D2's generator-completeness gap and not this one.

The architecture does not depend on that mechanism being fixed upstream. It never needed a runtime
clock to be *correct*; the explicit value was always authoritative, and the runtime mirror existed
only as a migration convenience. Removing it costs the convenience and buys a simpler contract.

What it costs is specific and belongs in the implementation plan rather than being discovered
during it: **the clock seam must be routed completely before a profile can claim conformance, not
incrementally.** With no runtime virtualization there is no interval in which a residual direct
`std/clock.now` read is merely unrecorded-but-deterministic — such a read is nondeterministic, so it
is a hermeticity failure like any other unrouted ambient effect, and it is caught by the same D5
mechanisms rather than by a clock-specific one. Two detectors apply, and they are different in kind:
the **source and ABI routing audit** enumerates such reads as a conservative textual site inventory
over explicit `src` + `packages` roots, per D5 obligation 2, and is the one a profile depends
on; **withholding the `Clock` capability** from a deterministic run is a coarse fail-closed backstop
that stops the run rather than returning a typed result.

That backstop is a **run-time** check, and an earlier revision of this decision described it as
"a build-and-profile-level gate, not an in-execution one". It is neither. `{Clock}` stays in the
effect row and AILANG fails only when a read is actually *performed*: a function whose row contains
`{Clock}` but whose taken branch never calls `now()` runs to completion with the capability
withheld. Verified against the real driver — the deterministic entry point completes with `Clock`
withheld while the live world on the same driver dies with `effect 'Clock' requires capability, but
none provided`.

The correction cuts both ways and both halves matter to a profile. The backstop is **stronger** than
previously assumed, because it catches unrouted reads on the paths a run actually takes rather than
merely declared ones. It is also **weaker**, because it says nothing about reachable paths a given
run did not exercise, so it cannot on its own discharge the all-or-nothing routing requirement
above. The source/ABI audit remains the primary detector; this is a per-run backstop.

**The clock set is larger than earlier revisions assumed, and most of it is not in the core.** The
**repo-wide inventory** across `src` and `packages` at HEAD on pinned v0.26.0 is **13 distinct call
sites, not 4**:

| Location | Sites | Routed at HEAD | Profile-reachable when |
|---|---|---|---|
| `src/core/session.ail` driver (`791`, `842`, `1991`, `2089`) | 4 | no | always — driver code (clause 1) |
| `src/core/ext/runtime.ail` `emit_dummy_hook` (`190`) | 1 | no | the `test_dummy` hook is installed (clause 3) |
| `packages/motoko-ext-compose` (`compose` 6, `author_tools` 1, `authoring/dispatcher` 1) | 8 | no | `compose` is installed (clause 2) |

Every condition is an **installation** condition. An earlier revision qualified the `compose` row with
"and the model calls `Compose`" — the execution-path test the definition below forbids, and factually
too narrow besides, since the response-intercept path reads the clock without any `Compose` tool call
(`packages/motoko-ext-compose/compose.ail:767`, inside `on_response_intercept` at `:761-790`).

**This is a repo-wide inventory, not a per-profile reachable set, and the two must not be conflated.**
An earlier revision called the eight `compose` reads "reachable under the *default* profile, not an
exotic one." That is false against the checked-in configuration: `.motoko/config/default/config.json`
lists an extension order of `empty_stop_guard`, `progress_contract_guard`, `compaction_ai`,
`context_mode`, `exa_search`, `scratchpad`, `compaction_structural` — no `compose`. `compose` appears
only in `.motoko/config/ailang/config.json`, `test_dummy` in no checked-in config at all, and
`parse_tokens` (`src/core/ext/registry_generated.ail:51-65`) instantiates only hooks whose name
appears in the configured order. Under the default configuration nine of the thirteen are
unreachable, and **no checked-in configuration realizes all thirteen.** The dispatch chain is
genuinely there once `compose` is installed — `handle_compose_tool` is the `on_tool_handle` hook — but
installation is the precondition, and that is a property of the named D5 profile, not of this table.

**Each D5 simulation profile must therefore state its own reachable clock set, derived from its
extension list, and route that set completely (D4's all-or-nothing rule).** The number 13 bounds the
work; it does not describe any profile. Under the installation scoping defined below: a profile
installing neither `compose` nor `test_dummy` — which is every checked-in configuration except
`.motoko/config/ailang` — has **four** sites to route; one installing `compose` but not `test_dummy`,
which is `.motoko/config/ailang`, has **twelve**; one installing both would have all **thirteen**,
and no checked-in configuration does. **These are the post-table numbers.** Until the attribution
table validates, `src/core/ext/runtime.ail:190` has no attribution and falls back to unconditional
core, so the split is **5 / 13 / 13** and the twelve-versus-thirteen distinction the table's third row
draws does not yet exist.

**Nothing is routed at HEAD.** An earlier revision of this table reported 14 sites, added a separate
`conversation_loop_v2` row, and said "only the first row is routed" — all three were measured on the
spike's surgically-modified driver and imported into this ADR as HEAD state. Corrected: the driver
has exactly four `now()` sites (`now` has a single binding, `import std/clock (now)` at `session.ail:30`,
so no alias hides a fifth); `conversation_loop_v2` performs no read of its own; and the path the
fifth row was reaching for is real but is not a distinct site — `run_v2_with_conversation` calls
`derive_session_id`, whose fallback branch is the already-counted `:791`. The spike demonstrated
that the four driver sites *can* be routed on a throwaway branch; that surgery is not at HEAD and is
not gate evidence.

Counting the `test_dummy` hook, nine of the thirteen sit behind an extension hook
rather than in the driver. The seam that would route them already exists — `ExtPorts.clock_now` in
`packages/motoko-ext-abi/types.ail` — and it has **zero call sites repo-wide**, so it has never been
exercised and may not survive first contact unchanged. Routing the clock is therefore not a
core-only task, and the implementation plan must budget the extension-side work and its version
surfaces rather than discovering them inside Track 1.

Because no real sleeping occurs, modeled time is free: a program that advances the clock past a
thirty-second deadline costs no wall-clock time, where the mirrored design would have blocked for
thirty real seconds. Determinism no longer trades against gate runtime.

External shell, MCP, and OS-process timeout mechanisms remain real-time operations and are never
invoked as the clock oracle in a deterministic run. Each deterministic run still uses a fresh
evaluator or process, now for ambient-state isolation generally rather than to prevent one seed
inheriting another's runtime virtual time.

`AdvanceClock(delta)` and timed outcomes must reject negative or overflowing movement. A program may
hold time still or advance it by an explicit duration. When a world request carries a deadline, the
deterministic adapter compares the generated completion time with that deadline and returns the same
typed completion/timeout result that the live adapter exposes. Production retry, timeout, and
deadline derivation remains production code. Completion-versus-deadline resolution is a shared pure
helper or an explicit conformance-tested adapter contract, not duplicated ad hoc in the generator.

Clock normalization remains appropriate for nondeterministic display-only fields. It does not
satisfy this decision. Before adopting the DST name, at least one generated trajectory pair must
hold the request and underlying completion result constant while changing only latency/clock
advancement, and demonstrate the expected different observed completion-versus-timeout (or
equivalent deadline/retry) behavior. Both programs must replay deterministically.

If no production behavior observes time, merely carrying unused clock interactions does not meet
the gate. At HEAD, the core retry loop is count/budget based and session `now()` calls primarily
derive ids and durations; several tool/process adapters enforce real external timeouts. The first
time-bearing seam should therefore be **the typed `ToolCallEnvelope` with deadline information that
D1 already mandates in place of the stringly `tool_exec`** — in core, in-profile, and a widening this
ADR requires anyway. Name that rather than an "existing timeout": the two adapters this ADR's Context
row cites as timeout-bearing (`motoko-ext-mcp`, `motoko-ext-context-mode`) are extension-resident and
excluded by D5, and core carries a timeout-bearing *request* (`src/core/tool_catalog.ail:53`,
`src/core/env_client.ail:31`) whose enforcement is deliberately outside the AILANG driver. **No
in-profile module observes time today**, which is precisely why the seam is a contract to build rather
than one to adapt. The project must not invent a new
agent retry policy merely to make the clock observable.

These two requirements are distinct and must not be conflated during planning. *Which* seam
demonstrates that time matters is a choice, and a tool or delegated-process deadline is the cheapest
first one. *How much* of the clock must be routed is not a choice: complete routing of every
profile-reachable time read is a precondition of conformance, because there is no longer a
virtualization layer under which an unrouted read would still be deterministic. A profile may be
narrow, but within its declared scope the clock seam is all-or-nothing.

**"Profile-reachable" is installation-scoped, not the result of a reachability analysis**, and the
distinction is load-bearing because D5's inventory explicitly does not decide reachability. An effect
site or hook is profile-reachable when it is:

1. in the core driver; or
2. in a module the profile *installs*; or
3. in a core effect site **attributed to an installed hook** by the profile's versioned
   site-to-hook attribution table.

Clauses 1 and 2 are answered by the profile's extension list plus the module inventory. Clause 3 is
answered by an explicit recorded artifact, not by inspection. The term applies to **effect sites and
hooks alike**: a profile-reachable hook is every hook the profile installs, whether or not any corpus
run invokes it.

**Clause 3 is an attribution table, not a semantic test, and an earlier revision got this wrong.** It
read "guarded solely by an installed hook's identity" — a control-path property that the profile list
and module inventory cannot decide, and one whose failure direction is wrong. A site guarded by hook
identity *and* something else fails "solely", falls through unclassified, and is then not required to
be routed: **fail-open**, in the decision that exists to close exactly that hole. Mixed guards are not
hypothetical here — `src/core/tool_phase.ail:222` guards an effectful call with
`is_scratchpad_tool_name(envelope.tool) && scratchpad_extension_active(rt)`.

The mechanical rule, stated so the empty-intersection case has one answer: **a core effect site with
a valid table row is profile-reachable exactly when that row's hook set intersects the profile's
installed hooks; a site with no valid row is an unconditional core site under clause 1.** Only a
*missing or invalid* row falls back to clause 1 — an empty intersection means the site is genuinely
unreachable in that profile, which is the fact the table exists to express. An earlier revision said
every site is "attributed to one or more **installed** hooks or is unconditional core", which sent
the empty-intersection case to clause 1 and contradicted the source-global rule twelve lines later.
Fail-closed still governs everything else: unknown hook ids, stale bindings, malformed rows, and
un-attributed sites. Additional guards never remove a site from an
attributed hook's scope — attribution is a claim about which hook can cause the site to execute, not
about the guard being the only condition.

**The table is a constructed, validated artifact, not a name for an intention**, and it gets the same
treatment D6 gives the event vocabulary because it carries the same kind of weight:

- **Contents and binding.** One row per core effect site: the site, its effect, the **known** hook
  ids it is attributed to, and the named reviewer who accepted that attribution. The table is a
  single source-global artifact bound to a source revision; a source change that adds, moves, or
  re-guards a core effect site invalidates it. **A profile records a *reference* to it — the table's
  identity, where identity is the pair `(source revision, content hash)` — not a copy.** An earlier
  revision had the profile record the table itself, and justified the change by saying a copy would
  force a version bump on every profile after a global correction. **That rationale was wrong**: a
  recorded content hash has exactly the same cost, since correcting one row changes the hash and every
  referring profile must be re-issued. The reference form is still right, for the reasons that
  actually hold — one source of truth, no divergent embedded copies, and a bounded profile artifact —
  and the consequence is stated rather than papered over: **a table correction re-issues every profile
  that references it.**
- **Correctness condition.** An attribution asserts that **installation of at least one attributed
  hook is a *necessary* condition of the site executing** — not a sufficient one. Necessity is what
  makes removal from clause 1 safe; sufficiency is what mixed guards break, and requiring it would
  reintroduce the path analysis this clause exists to avoid.
- **Scope.** Only effect sites **after** the simulation boundary are attributable. Host configuration
  discovery, package hydration, and child-process setup sit outside that boundary and must not be
  pulled into the world by an attribution.
- **The table is source-global; profiles intersect against it.** It is keyed on **known** hook
  identities, not installed ones, and a profile computes its reachable set by intersecting each row's
  hook set with what it installs. An earlier revision had validation reject a row naming an
  *uninstalled* hook — which defeats the table's whole purpose, since the absence of `test_dummy` is
  exactly the fact that removes `src/core/ext/runtime.ail:190` from a profile's reachable set. Under
  that rule the row could not exist in any checked-in configuration, the site defaulted to
  unconditional core, and the driver obligation was five. Reject **unknown** hook ids; permit
  known-but-uninstalled ones.
- **Validation, and what it does not do.** At profile load, failing closed on a site that is neither
  in the table nor unconditional-core, on an entry naming an *unknown* hook, on a stale
  source-revision binding, and on a malformed row. **These are schema, staleness, and
  referential-integrity checks. None of them tests the correctness condition**, because necessity is
  a control-path property and computing it is what this clause exists to avoid. An earlier revision
  claimed that stating the condition precisely made it "a checkable claim rather than left to the
  author's judgement"; that is a non-sequitur, and the bullet above is the evidence. **Necessity is
  manually reviewed and the profile definition records a named reviewer per attribution row.** A
  well-formed but false attribution — say, `src/core/rpc.ail:200` attributed to `test_dummy`, which
  would drop a live core `SharedMem` read from every profile not installing it — passes every
  mechanical check.

  **No mechanical check is offered, and an earlier revision's attempt is withdrawn rather than
  patched.** That revision proposed *syntactic dominance* — the attributed site must be textually
  dominated by a guard naming the hook id — and cited `src/core/ext/runtime.ail`'s five
  `if is_test_dummy(h.id)` guards as satisfying it. **They do not.** The attributed site is `:190`,
  inside `emit_dummy_hook` (`:187-195`), which contains no guard at all; the five guards dominate the
  five *calls* to that function, and relating them to the site follows a call edge — the
  interprocedural reasoning this clause exists to avoid. The check was also not conservative: no
  guard text contains the hook id (`"test_dummy"` lives inside `is_test_dummy` at `:197-199`), so a
  rule matching the helper name would equally accept `if not is_test_dummy(h.id)`, under which the
  site executes exactly when the hook is **absent** — the maximally false attribution, passing the
  check meant to catch it. A mechanical check that fails its own worked example and admits its own
  counterexample is worse than none, because it invites reliance.

  **A sound replacement is specified as its own obligation rather than deferred to an unrelated
  detector.** The *attribution-necessity validator* must resolve each guard predicate to a positive
  equality test against the attributed hook id, prove that every call to the function containing the
  site is dominated by such a guard, reject negation, and treat any row it cannot prove as **invalid**
  — which sends the site to unconditional core rather than removing it. This is interprocedural and
  does not exist. An earlier revision assigned it to obligation 2's successor detector; that is wrong,
  because declared-versus-performed reconciliation resolves neither hook-id predicates nor dominance.

  **Until that validator exists, necessity rests on the recorded named reviewer, and that is a stated
  exception to the acceptance table's promise that every answer is supported by an automated gate.**
  Naming the exception is the point: an unproven attribution now *removes* a site from the reachable
  set under the empty-intersection rule, so a wrong positive shrinks coverage silently rather than
  merely over-counting. No D4 routing-completeness or D5 conformance claim may cite an
  attribution-derived reachable set until either the validator lands or the profile records the
  reviewer for every row it relies on.
- **Producer.** Construction, in the same change that builds obligation 2's classifiers — the
  classifiers enumerate the effect sites the table must account for, so building either without the
  other leaves a gap.
- **Scheduling.** As with D6's vocabulary, **no D4 routing-completeness claim and no D5 conformance
  claim may be scheduled before the table exists and validates.** Until then "four driver clock
  reads" is not yet *derived*: without an attribution for `src/core/ext/runtime.ail:190`, the
  fail-closed default counts it as unconditional core and the driver obligation is five. Pre-table the
  split is 5 / 13 / 13; post-table it is the 4 / 12 / 13 stated in D4.

**Amendment, 2026-08-03 (WI-A5 implemented). The table now exists and validates
(`src/core/dst_attribution_table.ail`, `make attribution_table`), and building it against HEAD
falsified two anchors in the text above and one number in D4's clock table.**

**1. The mixed-guard example moved.** `src/core/tool_phase.ail:222` is cited above as the mixed guard
`is_scratchpad_tool_name(envelope.tool) && scratchpad_extension_active(rt)`. WI-A12 rewrote that file.
The guard is now at `:286` and the effectful call it guards — `exec_scratchpad_cell_ws` — is at
`:287`. **The example is intact; only its coordinates are stale.** The shipped row cites `:287`, and
`make attribution_table` re-checks every cited line's *content* on each run, so the next move is
caught by name rather than by a reader noticing.

**2. The core clock inventory is no longer four driver sites.** D4's table says four. At HEAD there
are **five** routed core sites — WI-A12 added `tool_phase.ail:342` — and **two** ambient core sites
that did not exist when the table was written: `session.ail:796` (`ext_unrouted_clock`, created by
A12 under plan rule S2) and `stub_step.ail:146` (`live_ports`' real clock). The `4 / 12 / 13` and
`5 / 13 / 13` splits above describe a source tree that A12 has since changed, and no artifact should
be re-derived from them.

The consequence for this clause is a design one and it is already discharged: **the completeness
check takes the discovered site set as an argument and never as a constant.** A validator holding its
own copy of "the thirteen sites" agrees with itself by construction and goes stale exactly when the
source moves — which is what happened here, twice, inside one milestone.

**3. An unattributed core site can be UNROUTED, and clause 1's fallback does not say so.** The rule
above sends a site with no valid row to unconditional core, which is right. But `session.ail:796` is
core, unattributed, and deliberately **not routed** (plan S2: `ExtPorts.clock_now`'s zero-argument
shape admits no world capture, so a loud ambient read was chosen over a silently frozen snapshot).
A profile that folded it into "the unconditional set, all routed" would be asserting something false.
The shipped declaration therefore carries `routed` per site, and an unrouted entry is a **declared,
visible gap** rather than an absent one. Whether such a profile is conformant is D4's all-or-nothing
rule to apply and WI-A10's to apply it; this clause's job is to make the fact impossible to miss.

**4. A trap worth recording, because it would have inverted the empty-intersection rule silently.**
Rows name base hook ids (`test_dummy`, `scratchpad`); installed hooks do not carry them.
`parse_tokens` (`src/core/ext/registry_generated.ail:52-64`) stamps every instance as
`"${name}#${idx}"`, so a live registry holds `scratchpad#5`. Under plain string equality a row's
`scratchpad` intersects **nothing**, the intersection is empty, and the empty-intersection rule then
declares the site genuinely unreachable and drops it from the profile — the exact inverse of what the
attribution says, arrived at without an error message. This is D4's own fail-open shape re-entering
through the matching function rather than through the rule, and the acceptance evidence for it is a
test rather than this paragraph.

Clause 3 is not a technicality. `src/core/ext/runtime.ail:190` reads the clock inside
`emit_dummy_hook`, in a core module present in *every* profile, behind five `emit_dummy_hook` calls
(`:206`, `:222`, `:245`, `:287`, `:374`), each guarded by `if is_test_dummy(h.id)` (`:206`, `:222`,
`:239`, `:280`, `:368`) — two of the five guards are inline with their call, three open a block above
it.
Clauses 1 and 2 alone would classify it as always-reachable, making the driver's obligation five
sites rather than four. Attributed to `test_dummy`, it is reachable exactly when that hook is
installed, and no checked-in configuration installs it.

The term does **not** mean "a site some execution path can actually perform." Deciding that would
require the reachability analysis D5 obligation 3 declines to require and nothing here builds. The
consequence is deliberately conservative: a site in an installed extension counts and must be routed
even if no run in the corpus reaches it. Withholding the `Clock` capability remains the per-run
backstop for anything that slips through, and it catches executed paths only.

### D5. Execution uses the real traced driver and a named conformant profile

The runner executes an `ExecutionProgram` through `Session.run_v2_session_traced` or a successor
that retains the same production driver, threads D1 world state, and returns a complete trace. The
ordinary `run_v2_from_messages` message-only result is not the DST oracle.

Every run names its **simulation profile** and records an **execution manifest**. The stable,
versioned profile defines the extension hooks, adapter/parser boundaries, resource models, and
effect policy included in the system under test. The per-run manifest pins the core revision,
toolchain, and exact extension/package/ABI versions that realized that profile. “Motoko DST” means
the core under the named profile and recorded manifest; it does not imply that every installable
production extension is hermetic or covered.

A versioned profile definition records:

- profile id/version;
- included extension ids and per-hook classifications (effect-free, world-mediated, or explicitly
  excluded);
- included and excluded provider/tool adapter and parser boundaries;
- logical resource models promised by the profile;
- permitted diagnostic projections;
- forbidden ambient effects/capabilities during execution;
- every required D3 fault class the profile waives, each with the condition that waives it; and
- a **reference to the site-to-hook attribution table** (D4 clause 3) under which its
  profile-reachable set was computed — table identity, source-revision binding, and content hash, not
  a copy of the table;
- **per-extension hook disclosure**: for every installed extension, the **hook ids** covered and the
  hook ids excluded — names, not counts, since counts cannot distinguish a covered no-op from covered
  behaviour. The two sets must be disjoint and must exhaust all eight ABI slots; and
- **omitted extensions**: any extension excluded from the install list because a classifier-2 call or
  an unconditionally-dispatched hook made it un-runnable in this profile, named with the reason. An
  *installed* extension with zero covered hooks is a profile-definition rejection (D5); there is no
  carve-out.

**Amendment, 2026-08-03 (WI-A10 implemented; `fd4f4bd`, `dafe898`). The ten fields above are not
decidable as stated, and three more are required.** Each closes a case where a stated D5 obligation
has no field to carry it, so a definition could satisfy every listed field and still leave the
obligation unfalsifiable:

- **`unrouted_reachable_sites`.** D5 and D4 give the routing rule as all-or-nothing but provide no
  field for a site that is reachable, unrouted, and *declared*. Without one, a stated containment and
  a silent gap are indistinguishable. WI-A10's decision 1 makes a profile with such a site conformant
  **only** when the site is declared and names an instrument — with a blank instrument, an undeclared
  site, and a declaration for a site that is no longer reachable-and-unrouted all rejections. The
  strict reading was rejected because it makes conformance unachievable at HEAD by construction
  (`session.ail:796` cannot be routed on the pin at all) and because it inverts the plan's rule S2,
  which deliberately chose the loud unrouted read over the silent frozen one.
- **`scan_roots`.** Obligation 2 scopes the routing scan to explicit roots; a profile installing a
  package whose AILANG source lies outside them is claiming coverage over source nothing scanned.
  The roots must be *in* the definition for that to be checkable.
- **`exercised_fault_classes`.** D3 requires a conditional class the profile does not exercise to be
  NAMED waived with its condition. The complement is not recoverable from the waiver list alone, so
  an unstated waiver is indistinguishable from an exercised class.

**Also: the ten fields are TWELVE record fields, and an implementer counting ten will merge two that
D5 separates.** Id and version are one field and two records; and field 2 (extension ids *and*
per-hook classifications) is two records, with the per-extension hook disclosure a third — D5 lists
the disclosure separately from the classifications precisely because ids and classifications are
different claims, and merging them loses the distinction the disclosure exists to carry.

Changing any of those semantic scope fields requires a profile-version change. The execution
manifest separately records source revision, toolchain, extension package versions, ABI version,
profile id/version, event-vocabulary version (D6), and normalized profile configuration. Source or
package updates therefore
remain exactly reproducible without pretending that every build creates a new semantic profile;
if an update changes the profile's coverage or effect classification, the profile version must
also change.

An extension may appear as covered in a conformant profile only when every hook reachable within
that profile is either:

1. deterministic and effect-free for its explicit inputs; or
2. effectful only through D1 world-mediated ports, with origin tagged by extension id and explicit
   world state returned to the host.

An explicitly excluded hook is not covered, must be named in the result, and causes a fail-closed
`HarnessFailure` if dispatch reaches it. Thus a run cannot gain coverage credit merely because its
seed happened not to exercise a direct-effect hook.

**Exclusion is a coverage cost for *conditionally dispatched* hooks, and an un-runnable configuration
for the rest.** The distinction is forced by the dispatch shape and an earlier revision missed it
entirely, asserting that a profile installing an extension with all hooks excluded is "conformant and
inert rather than invalid". **It is neither: it cannot complete a single run.** Six of the eight ABI
hook slots are dispatched by an unconditional fold over `rt.registry.hooks`
(`src/core/ext/runtime.ail:205, 220, 238, 279, 355, 367`); only `on_tool_handle` is gated, by
`contains_tool` at `:337-338`. So an excluded `on_build_system_prompt` is reached on the first
system-prompt build, before any provider call, and the run terminates as `HarnessFailure`. Such a
profile emits zero `SystemRun`s and can satisfy neither D11's minimum completed count nor any D7
invariant.

**Amendment, 2026-08-02 (WI-A6 implemented; `935bd46`). SEVEN slots are unconditionally dispatched,
not six, and the paragraph above leaves the eighth unaccounted for.** Six plus one gated is seven;
the missing slot is `on_describe_tools`, and it is unconditional:

```text
src/core/tool_catalog.ail:114   collect_ext_schemas folds EVERY registered hook
src/core/tool_catalog.ail:125   tools_with_extensions calls that fold
src/core/test/stub_step.ail:133 live_ports calls it on EVERY model step
```

The survey above looked only in `src/core/ext/runtime.ail`, where six dispatches live. The seventh
is in the tool catalogue because it builds the schema list rather than driving the loop, and it is
reached at least as often as any of the six. **The consequence is load-bearing: a profile excluding
`on_describe_tools` must be rejected, and under "six" it would have loaded clean.** Both readings
type-check and the wrong one is silent, so the correction is carried by an assertion rather than by
this paragraph — `test_seven_slots_are_unconditional` and the `describe_tools_excluded` fixture in
`scripts/dst/profile_coverage_dst.ail`, plus a structural guard in `make profile_coverage` that
counts the ABI record's `on_*` fields. The general lesson, recorded because it already recurred once
in this project: **when a count and an enumeration disagree by one, the enumeration is the claim —
find the missing member before trusting the count.** The current live line numbers are
`ext/runtime.ail:213, 229, 275, 319, 363, 414` unconditional and `:337` gated.

**The rule the dispatch shape actually forces: an extension with any *unconditionally dispatched* hook
excluded may not be installed in a conformant profile — it must be omitted from the install list.**
Exclusion remains a real and useful classification for conditionally dispatched hooks (today
`on_tool_handle`) and for negative conformance probes, where reaching an exclusion *should* fail
closed. It is not a way to neutralise an installed extension.

Two consequences, and both simplify. First, the fourteen checked-in configurations are made conformant
by **removing** `compaction_ai` from the profile's install list, not by excluding its hooks — which is
what *Gate mechanisms* and the interim-profile statement already say independently: the first interim
profile is the real driver plus the main-loop cursor. Second, **the coverage floor's classifier-2
carve-out is deleted and the floor binds unconditionally.** The carve-out existed to bless a
zero-coverage installed extension; that configuration cannot execute, so there is nothing to bless.
Deleting it removes classifier 2 from the floor's dependency chain and removes the one fail-open
direction in the deferred layer.

**Anti-laundering needs two mechanisms, and earlier revisions each supplied only one.** One revision
required "at least one covered hook per installed extension". **That rule is vacuous, because
`ExtensionHooks` is a closed record whose per-field effect rows are properties of the ABI rather than
of the extension** (`packages/motoko-ext-abi/types.ail:151-165`). Every
extension gets `on_describe_tools`, `on_build_system_prompt`, and `on_tool_policy` with **no effect
row at all**, so a profile that installs everything and excludes every hook carrying behaviour still
satisfies a one-hook floor — by covering a constant-returning no-op, which is exactly the
configuration the floor was written to forbid.

**That is the whole of the case against the old floor, and an earlier revision claimed a second
ground that is false.** It said the closed record pins *every* behavioural hook at nine effects, so no
behaviour-carrying hook is coverable and the floor is unsatisfiable. Wrong twice: `on_budget_plan` is
at `! {Env, FS}`, not nine; and three slots — `on_describe_tools`, `on_build_system_prompt`,
`on_tool_policy` — carry no row at all and are coverable, with real branching logic in
`on_tool_policy` today. **The floor was therefore satisfiable**, and a correction pass that retracted
this claim elsewhere left it standing here, where it was doing the work. The remaining objection is
the one above and it is about *information*, not satisfiability: a one-hook floor cannot tell a
covered no-op from covered behaviour.

**Two mechanisms are needed, because one rejects and the other informs, and neither does the other's
job.** An earlier revision deleted the floor and kept only disclosure, on the reasoning that
disclosure "achieves what the floor was for". It does not: a reporting obligation is satisfied by
reporting, so a profile that installs fourteen extensions and covers nothing passes the clause it
previously failed. That is a real weakening and it was not the intent.

1. **The floor is restored, in the form that was always decidable.** *Not every hook of an installed
   extension may be excluded* — a profile that covers zero hooks of something it installs must not
   list it as installed. **The floor binds unconditionally: there is no carve-out.** An earlier
   revision carried
   one, for extensions whose hooks classifier 2 forced fully excluded — but per D5 that configuration
   cannot execute at all, so it is omitted from the install list rather than blessed. Deleting the
   carve-out also deletes the reverse-validation obligation it needed (match the recorded
   `(extension, field)` pair against the typed call inventory), and with it the only fail-open
   direction in the deferred layer.
2. **Disclosure carries the information the floor cannot.** The profile definition and the run result
   both record, per installed extension, the **hook ids** covered and the hook ids excluded — names,
   not counts. `compaction_ai` is not the example, because it calls `ai_step` and is therefore omitted
   from a conformant profile rather than installed at all. The distinction names carry is between two
   *installed* extensions that both report three covered: one whose three rowless slots are constant
   returns, and `compose`, whose `on_tool_policy` binds real dispatch (`compose.ail:838` → `:83`). A
   count cannot tell those apart; the hook ids can, because they say *which* slots are covered rather
   than how many — which is the distinction the floor was reaching for and could never express.

The two are validated together at profile load: the sets must be disjoint and must exhaust all eight
ABI slots; no installed extension may have zero covered hooks; and no installed extension may have an
unconditionally-dispatched hook excluded.

**Per-hook classification reads *declared* effect rows in the interim, not performed ones.** The
reconciling detector that would let a profile claim a hook performs less than it declares is
explicitly unavailable (obligation 2's successor detector), so a hook declaring
`{IO, Process, FS, AI, Env, Net, SharedMem, Clock, Stream}` while returning a constant is **not**
effect-free for classification purposes.

**AMENDMENT applied at WI-D10 (measured WI-D9; reviewed independently and accepted with four
conditions, all of which are applied here). Criterion 2 is a claim about behaviour and its text
admits evidence other than a declared row. The declared-row rule is nonetheless RETAINED, and the
reason is not the criterion's wording — it is that no producer in this tree can supply criterion 2's
evidence, and the successor detector named above cannot supply it in principle.**

Criterion 2 reads: *"effectful only through D1 world-mediated ports, with origin tagged by extension
id and explicit world state returned to the host."* Nothing in that sentence names a declared row.
The declared-row reading is a separate, explicitly **interim** classification rule stated in the
paragraph above, adopted when no other instrument existed and pending obligation 2's successor
detector. Eleven work items have evaluated criterion 2 against declared rows on that basis and each
was right to. This amendment records that the basis was tested, and what the test found.

**1. The successor detector is the wrong instrument for criterion 2, and no narrowing of it will
help.** The detector this ADR defers is a *declared-versus-performed reconciler* — it lets a profile
claim a hook performs less than it declares. That reconciles the **set of effect labels**. Criterion
2 is not a claim about labels; it is a claim about the **call path**. Measured at WI-D9 against the
shipped ABI and reproduced at review against the *imported* `ExtCtx`/`ExtPorts`/`AiStepOutcome`, with
a two-sided control:

```text
mediated(ctx, …) -> AiStepOutcome ! {AI, IO, Trace}   -- body: ctx.ports.ai_step(…)      ACCEPTED
ambient (ctx, …) -> AiStepOutcome ! {AI, IO, Trace}   -- body: println + trace + ai.call ACCEPTED

control: each of the two, declared one effect short   -> BOTH REJECTED, "Missing effects: Trace"
```

The controls establish that the effect checker is running on both bodies and is sensitive to labels.
It assigns the identical verdict to a fully port-mediated body and a fully ambient one. **A declared
row cannot distinguish mediation from ambience, at any width, and a reconciled performed row cannot
either — both are label sets. The effect checker is blind to provenance by construction.**

**2. On fourteen of the fifteen registrable extensions, the slot's row constrains the binding in
neither direction.** Derived from `src/core/ext/registry_generated.ail`, one binding site per
extension, residue empty, with package directories resolved from `ailang.toml` rather than by name
convention: **fourteen bind `on_pre_step` as an inline function expression in record-field position;
one (`compaction_structural`) binds a named top-level function.** On the shipped ABI record an
inline record-field binding's declared row is **inert** — it neither catches an effect the body
performs and the row omits, nor discharges one the row names (see the amended record-field passage
below). For those fourteen the operative constraint is `register_with_config`'s row, and `Env` is
admitted by 14 of the 14 registration rows that exist.

**Therefore criterion 2 may be established by measurement only by a producer with all four of the
following properties, and no such producer exists at HEAD:**

- **Provenance, not labels.** It must decide, for each effect a hook can perform, whether the call
  that performs it is a field call on an `ExtPorts`-typed value. Per plan rule S16 it must not derive
  from the declaration being tested, which rules out every row-reading instrument.
- **Total over the extension, not over one file.** Criterion 2 quantifies over every hook an
  installed extension registers, so the unit is the extension's transitive module closure — not the
  module that happens to hold the hook's chain. (The claim currently recorded for `compaction_ai` at
  `src/core/dst_driver_only.ail:597` is scoped to `compaction_ai.ail`; the hook is bound in
  `register.ail`, which imports `std/env` and `std/fs`.) Measured at review, the closures are
  **2–17 modules** per extension and none reaches `src/core/session.ail`, so this property is
  cheaper than it sounds.
- **Symbol-granular.** Classifier 1 partitions **modules**, so `import std/ai (Message)` — a type
  import — reads as effect-bearing. Criterion 2 needs the imported *symbol*, or every extension
  touching a type from an effect-bearing module fails. **This property has a dependency that is
  broken at HEAD; it is named in full below.**
- **Fail-closed on what it cannot resolve**, on classifier 2's discipline: every alias, wrapper,
  re-export and computed access it cannot resolve to a typed receiver is a rejection, not a pass.

**The producer this describes is not the successor detector and is not blocked by the record-field
limitation**, because it is structural — an import-and-call-name closure — rather than type-based. It
is most of obligation 2 clause 2, which this ADR specifies ("a conservative textual inventory of
ambient-effect imports and call names, per in-profile module, at *site* granularity"). Call it
**classifier 3**. Its admission to *Gate mechanisms: built, and deferred* as a fourth deferred
mechanism is **not made by this amendment**: that list was signed off as finite by both ADR-001
acceptance reviewers, and the count is theirs to change. The architecture test they applied — *"if
this mechanism turned out unbuildable, would D1–D11 still be the right architecture?"* — was applied
to classifier 3 at review and **answered yes**, on the same ground as the other three: its absence
degrades conservatively to exactly HEAD, costing *coverage* rather than correctness.

**Symbol granularity's dependency, named rather than assumed (condition A-1).** Classifier 3's
symbol-granular property needs per-symbol effect data — that `std/ai`'s `Message` is a type while
`call` is `! {AI}`. The ADR records classifier 1 as the built half of this specification. **At HEAD
that half is running on an unvalidated approximation and its own acceptance criterion is not met**:
`make effect_inventory` is green while reporting INTERFACE FAILURE for 46 of 46 stdlib modules, so
every module classification comes from the textual fallback, and `make effect_inventory_selftest`
**exits non-zero** with *"the self-test compared ZERO modules, so it certified nothing … a
pass-shaped absence, not a pass."* Classifier 1's recorded criterion has two clauses — zero
unresolved modules **and** the self-test reporting zero disagreements — and the second is failing.
Neither target is in `make dst`. **Classifier 1's status row is therefore to be read with that
qualification until it is repaired; repairing it is not this amendment's, and it is owed.**

**The dependency is nonetheless satisfiable, and it was probed at WI-D10 rather than assumed, because
this ADR should not assert a producer is buildable on an untested claim about a tool.** Three routes
to per-symbol effect data exist at HEAD, in increasing order of quality:

```text
1. per-declaration textual parse (the route the review named)
     46 modules, 465 exported symbols, unclaimed-`export` residue 0
     collapsing it back to a bool reproduces the shipped module derivation  46 / 46
     resolves this criterion's own example: std/ai.Message -> type, std/ai.call -> ! {AI}
     BUT FAILS OPEN on 44 of 465 symbols: 39 `export func` carrying no row at all
     (33 std/json, 4 std/net, 2 std/yaml) and 5 effect-POLYMORPHIC (std/list.mapE and
     siblings, `! {e}`). An unannotated row reads as "infer", not as "performs nothing".
2. the compiler's CACHED interface data, .ailang/cache/compile/modules/*/iface.json,
     schema ailang.iface/v1 — per-symbol, typed, separates `types` and `constructors`
     from `exports`, and distinguishes an effect VARIABLE from concrete labels.
     Covers 23 of 46 stdlib modules: exactly those this tree compiles against.
3. `ailang iface` stdout, which already emits funcs[].effects per symbol
     (std/env.getEnv -> ["Env"]). Blocked only by MOD010's path rule, not by a
     missing capability.
```

**So the property is buildable and the amendment does not rest on the broken route.** The
requirement this places on classifier 3 is stated rather than left to its builder: **the 44
fail-open symbols must be reported UNRESOLVED, not clean.** Under property 4 that is a rejection,
and it matters directly to the yield below — `std/json.jo` is one of the 39, and three of the four
ambient-free extensions import it.

**Until classifier 3 exists and reports clean for an extension, criterion 2 is evaluated on declared
rows and no profile may record `WorldMediated` on any other basis.** That is the fail-closed default
and it is what keeps this amendment from licensing a claim its evidence cannot support. **The
prohibition is prose, and what currently enforces it is the barrier count rather than the rule:**
`classification_agrees` (`src/core/dst_profile.ail:893-910`) validates a `WorldMediated` entry
against the disclosure's excluded-id list and against nothing else, so no check anywhere requires a
`WorldMediated` classification to have an evidentiary basis. That was already true before this
amendment and this amendment does not worsen it — verified at review: barrier count **3**,
`HookClassificationEntry` has no `basis` field, no `world_mediated` string in any checked-in profile
or fixture, and zero classification entries in the tree because `driver_only` installs nothing.

**Classifier 3's honest yield is 4 of 15, and that belongs in the specification because it is what
the instrument is worth (condition A-3).** Derived independently at review, the extensions whose
transitive closure imports **no** effect-bearing std module are:

```text
AMBIENT-FREE CLOSURES: 4 / 15
  decision_framework   compaction_structural   empty_stop_guard   progress_contract_guard
```

Because the unit is the extension's closure and the discipline is fail-closed, classifier 3 can never
clear a single hook of an extension whose closure is dirty — `compaction_ai` included, via
`register.ail`'s `std/env` and `std/fs`. The coarsening is *conservative*, so it is the right
direction, but it caps the instrument's reach at four extensions.

**When classifier 3 exists, three things change and each must be decided rather than inherited:**

- `HookClassificationEntry` (`src/core/dst_profile.ail:207`) gains a **basis** — the producer that
  established the classification and the artifact revision it ran at. A measured `WorldMediated` and
  a read one are different claims and today the record cannot tell them apart. This is also the fix
  for the unenforced prohibition above.
- The **barrier count changes shape.** `check_barrier_count`
  (`tools/profile_definition/check_fixtures.py:205`) derives barriers from the ABI row alone, which
  is a per-**slot** fact shared by all fifteen extensions; criterion 2 is per-hook-of-an-installed-
  extension. A measured basis makes a barrier a property of the **(extension, slot)** pair. The
  count is derived, so this is a change to the derivation, not to a number.
- **Route B is NECESSARY and is NOT shown sufficient (condition A-2).** Without this amendment Route
  B clears no barrier, because the routed rows would read `{Process, FS}` and be refused for exactly
  the reason `on_pre_step` is refused now. **Whether Route B plus classifier 3 clears the remaining
  two barriers is not recorded here, and an earlier draft's claim that it does is withdrawn as
  measured false.** Route B routes *calls* through world-mediated seams; a fail-closed closure
  classifier fails closed on the *imports*. Measured over every extension's transitive closure,
  effect-bearing std imports: `compose` (17 modules) — `std/ai`, `std/clock`, `std/env`, `std/fs`,
  `std/io`, `std/process`; `context_mode` (7 modules) — `std/env`, `std/fs`, `std/process`,
  `std/sem`. Classifier 3 reports **both DIRTY**, so those two barriers clear only if Route B also
  removes every effect-bearing std import from those closures. **What that costs is WI-C5's owner's
  estimate to revise; it is OWED and is deliberately not recorded here.**

**And the cheapest path to a non-zero coverage number runs through neither Route B nor an ABI change
(condition A-4).** Measured at review with a two-sided control, `compaction_structural`'s three
barrier-slot hook bodies are **effect-free**:

```text
pre_step's body verbatim, declared with NO effect row, outside the ABI record   -> ✓ ACCEPTED
  (its only call is compact_for_pre_step, which is `export pure func`)
on_response_intercept's body verbatim, no row                                   -> ✓ ACCEPTED
on_solver_candidate's body verbatim, no row                                     -> ✓ ACCEPTED
CONTROL: pre_step's body plus one getEnvOr, no row  -> REJECTED "Missing effects: Env"
```

Its closure is also ambient-free. **So classifier 3 alone, with zero Route B work, would clear all
three barriers for `compaction_structural`** — making it the tree's first installable extension and
the first non-zero extension-model coverage in this project. **Note what that classification would be
in substance: criterion 1, effect-free by measurement, vacuously satisfying criterion 2.** This
amendment withholds any change to criterion 1, which is right for an amendment about criterion 2, but
the consequence is stated rather than discovered: **the first hook classifier 3 clears will be one
that performs nothing, not one that mediates.**

<a id="adr-record-field-mechanism"></a>
**A declared row bounds performed effects in one direction only, and on the pin it does not bound
them through a lambda bound into a record field.** The effect checker is transitive through direct
builtin calls and through named helpers — a rowless function calling `println`, or calling a
`! {IO}` helper, is rejected with `Missing effects: IO`.

**AMENDED at WI-D10 (measured WI-D9, reviewed and accepted with conditions before application). An
earlier revision of this passage stated the gap as non-transitivity through a call on a
function-valued record field, and gave this repro:**

```text
type Ports = { ai_step: (string) -> string ! {AI, IO, Process, FS, Env, Net, SharedMem, Clock, Stream} }
func rowless_hook(p: Ports) -> string { p.ai_step("…") }   -- declares no row

$ ailang check   → ✓ No errors found!
$ ailang run     → EFFECT PERFORMED …
```

**The repro reproduces, and its stated consequence for the ABI is false. The non-transitivity is a
property of a LOCALLY DECLARED record type; through an IMPORTED one it does not hold.** So
"`ExtCtx.ports: ExtPorts` is exactly that shape" — the sentence three decisions below have cited
since WI-B4 — is **false of the shipped ABI**. Measured at WI-D9 and re-derived independently at
review, in four arms rather than two, because the two-arm version does not isolate the variable:

```text
(a) LOCAL  type PortsL = { ai_step: … ! {AI, IO, Trace} },   rowless caller  -> ✓ ACCEPTED
(b) IMPORT pkg/sunholo/motoko_ext_abi/types (ExtPorts),      rowless caller  -> REJECTED
                                                       "Missing effects: AI, IO, Trace"
(c) LOCAL record NESTING the imported ExtPorts                               -> REJECTED
(d) LOCAL copy of the field, using the IMPORTED result types verbatim        -> ✓ ACCEPTED
```

(c) and (d) are the bisection: the variable is **whether the record type carrying the
function-valued field is imported or locally declared**, not the types inside the field.

**What actually bites this tree is a different gap, and it is the one WI-D8 measured: a lambda bound
into a record field has an INERT declared row.** Confirmed on the shipped `ExtPorts`, both
directions:

```text
inline `ai_step: func(…) -> AiStepOutcome ! {AI, IO, Trace} { … getEnvOr(…) … }`
  -> Env escapes past the row to the enclosing builder        (the row catches nothing)
inline `ai_step: func(…) -> AiStepOutcome ! {AI, IO, Trace} { … println(…) … }`
  -> IO ALSO escapes, though the row DECLARES it              (the row discharges nothing)
control: the identical body as a NAMED top-level function
  -> REJECTED at the function itself, "Missing effects: Env"
```

**And the converse, which is load-bearing for the same conclusions: a named binding cannot declare
NARROWER than its slot, because the ABI record's rows are CLOSED.** Measured at review, narrowing
`on_pre_step` from `! {AI, IO, Trace}` to no row while keeping the binding:

```text
type error: failed to unify record field 'on_pre_step': failed to unify effect rows:
            incompatible closed rows: r1 has extra labels [],
                                      r2 has extra labels [AI IO Trace]
```

**So a hook whose body is measurably effect-free is still forced by the type system to carry its
slot's row, with no classifier involved.** The five non-rowless slots are therefore excludable-only
**by the type system**, not merely by the declared-row convention, and no amount of classifier work
changes that without an ABI change — which is why the deferred `motoko-ext-abi` major is a route to
extension coverage that does not depend on the classifier layer at all.

**Two things follow and both are consequential:**

- **A rowless ABI slot is not provably effect-free** — now by the inert-row mechanism rather than by
  call non-transitivity. An inline binding in a rowless slot can call `ctx.ports.ai_step` and the
  demand escapes to `register_with_config`; a *named* binding in a rowless slot cannot, and is
  rejected at the function itself. Classifying `on_describe_tools`, `on_build_system_prompt`, and
  `on_tool_policy` as coverable therefore remains an **assumption**, resting on the runtime
  hermeticity probe rather than on the type system. That is weaker than "reads declared rows"
  suggests, and it is stated here rather than left implicit because two decisions now lean on it.
- **This, not decidability, is why the classifier-2 rejection rule excludes *every* hook.** An earlier
  revision justified extension granularity solely on "nothing maps a call site to the hooks that can
  reach it" — and that argument does not distinguish the coarse rule from a narrowing to the five
  non-rowless hooks, which is equally decidable and reads off the same ABI type. The narrowing was
  proposed on exactly that ground and is **rejected**. On the corrected mechanism its premise needs
  one qualifier: *"a rowless hook can call `ai_step`"* is true of an **inline** binding and false of a
  **named** one. Fourteen of the fifteen registrable extensions bind inline, so the coarse rule
  remains the right one, and recording the real reason is what stops the narrowing being re-proposed
  a fourth time.

**What the correction costs the three items that banked on this passage, argued rather than
asserted.** WI-D6, WI-D7 and WI-D8 each banked *"a binding that starts reading `Env` in this slot now
fails to build."* On the corrected mechanism that prize is real at **1 of 15** `on_pre_step`
bindings — the single named binding, `compaction_structural` — and not at the 7 of 15 WI-D8 recorded.
WI-D8's table keyed on the **line** rather than on the **binding form**; re-derived at review, the
fifteen split 8 same-line + 6 alone-on-line + 1 named, and `6 + 1 = 7` is the figure that reached the
record. The enforcement did not vanish, it **moved** to `register_with_config`'s row — where `Env` is
admitted by **14 of the 14 registration rows that exist**. Measured end to end at review: a
`getEnvOr` added inside `compaction_ai`'s inline `on_pre_step` leaves `ailang check`,
`make profile_definition` and `make declared_vs_performed` green, with gate output **byte-identical**
to the unmutated tree.

**The narrowings were nonetheless worth taking, on a ground other than the prize they claimed:** they
cost nothing and are not reversible into a defect, and they are the **precondition** for the
register-row work, which is where essentially all enforcement for the other fourteen actually lives.
That makes the fourteen `register_with_config` rows the sharpest un-owned item in this project rather
than merely a deferred one.

The record-field propagation gap is an upstream soundness defect, not a Motoko one. **It is already
filed**, as ticket `fb_74f53de3ae65854c` (WI-A3, 2026-08-02) — an earlier revision of this passage
said it "belongs in an AILANG issue independently of this ADR", which read as owed work and was
quoted forward as such. **That filing is valid and NARROWER than this ADR applied it:** the
local-type repro is a real unsoundness and stays filed, while the inert inline row — the gap that
actually reaches every hook in this tree — is not covered by it and is recorded as owed.

Of `compaction_ai`'s seven trivial hooks, three declare that full row and `on_budget_plan`
declares `! {Env, FS}` — **four of the seven classify as effectful**
despite performing nothing, and only the three ABI-rowless slots are effect-free. The
extension-granularity rejection rule above already forces all eight to be excluded, so the two rules
agree there.

**The consequence for extension coverage is larger than the `ai_step` case and is stated here rather
than discovered later: under the declared-row rule, coverable extension behaviour is confined to the
three ABI-rowless hook slots.** The ABI pins `on_pre_step`, `on_tool_handle`, `on_response_intercept`,
and `on_solver_candidate` at nine effects and `on_budget_plan` at `{Env, FS}`, regardless of what the
extension actually does in them, so all five are excludable-only. The three remaining slots —
`on_describe_tools`, `on_build_system_prompt`, `on_tool_policy` — carry no row and are coverable.

That is a real coverage surface, not a technicality: `on_tool_policy` returns a genuine policy
decision and several extensions put real logic there (`compose.ail:838` → `:83`,
`context_mode.ail:80`, `omnigraph.ail:69`; `microrag`'s binding at `register.ail:189` looks like a
fourth but resolves to a constant `NoOpinion` at `:153-155`, and is named here so it is not
re-cited). A profile
can therefore cover tool-policy, prompt-construction, and tool-description behaviour while excluding
everything else.

**What it cannot cover is the interim profile's own candidates.** `empty_stop_guard` and
`progress_contract_guard` compute `decide` in `export pure func` form, but they are *reached* through
`on_solver_candidate`, which the ABI pins at nine effects — so the guards' behaviour classifies as
effectful and excludable-only, and the pair named below as the first useful interim profile covers
none of its own logic. The "pure guards may form the initial profile" line must be read that
narrowly. Widening coverage to the five pinned slots waits on either the successor detector or an ABI
that narrows per-hook rows, and both belong to the same major.

What *is*
invalid is installing an extension that **calls** a classifier-2 `ExtPorts` field on an
`ExtPorts`-typed value while any hook it registers is **not** excluded: such a path discards world
state with no fail-closed signal, so it is a **profile-definition rejection** rather than a runtime
exclusion. The interim `ExtPorts.ai_step` case is exactly this (D1), and obligation 2's classifier 2
supplies the **call-site** inventory. The predicate is a typed field *call* at **extension**
granularity — not a textual occurrence, not "reaches a seam", and not per-hook call-graph
reachability; D1 states why each of those was rejected.
The distinction matters because the two failures happen at different times and only one of them is
detectable at run time: an excluded hook fails closed when dispatch reaches it, while an un-excluded
reaching hook runs successfully and silently.

`AI`, `Process`, `Net`, `FS`, `SharedMem`, `Clock`, environment, or random effects from a reached
hook fail the profile's hermeticity probe **whether performed directly or through a port field**. An
earlier revision said "direct … effects", which read as exempting the port-mediated case — the one
case a rowless slot can actually exercise (see the record-field gap above), and therefore the one the
probe most needs to catch. Bounded `IO`/`Trace` projection may remain only
when it cannot feed back into the decision and is not the oracle. Current effectful extensions that
bypass `ExtCtx.ports` are excluded until migrated. **The "pure guards and deterministic fixture
hooks may form the initial profile" formulation of earlier revisions names two classes with no
available member today** and is retained only as a future statement: the two guards cover none of
their own logic, because `decide` is reached through `on_solver_candidate` (D1); and the repo's only
fixture package, `motoko_ext_conformance`, calls `ai_step` at `fixtures/reject_fixtures.ail:90`, so
under the extension-granularity rule every hook it registers is excluded and it covers nothing. It is
also absent from `src/core/ext/registry_generated.ail`, so it cannot be installed by configuration at
all. The first interim profile is the real driver plus the main-loop cursor, and it should be
described that way rather than by naming candidate extensions it cannot cover. Changing an
effectful extension to use state-threaded world ports may
require an `motoko-ext-abi` major and its existing lockstep rollout.

An effectful hook cannot retain the current “callback returns only a decision” shape while hiding
world mutation behind `ExtCtx.ports`. A conformant ABI must pass an explicit/opaque world token into
the hook's effect adapter and return the successor token with the hook decision, or provide an
equivalent host-owned linear state protocol. The implementation plan may choose the representation,
but hidden mutable port state is prohibited by D1.

The simulation boundary begins after the runner has decoded and validated its synthetic
configuration and constructed the named runtime/profile. Host configuration discovery, package
hydration, and TypeScript child-process setup remain in the existing harness-boundary tests. No
live secrets or inherited host environment values enter the deterministic world.

Capability flags are necessary but not sufficient because broad `IO` can permit both reporting and
`readLine`, and broad effect rows do not prove which operation was performed. Each profile's
hermeticity gate therefore combines:

- the narrowest executable capabilities, with generation and reporting separated where practical;
- a source/ABI routing audit for direct ambient calls in every in-profile module, subject to the
  structural-first rule below;
- a profile-reachable clock audit whose roots include the extension packages the profile installs,
  derived from that profile's extension list rather than from the repo-wide inventory: a profile
  installing `compose` cannot claim conformance until its eight clock reads route through
  `ExtPorts.clock_now`, and a profile installing none still has the four driver reads to route (D4);
- poison/negative probes for provider, tool, approval, environment, clock, random, and reached
  extension-effect bypasses; and
- profile-definition validation and runtime routing that fail closed when an unclassified
  extension, hook, or adapter is loaded or reached, **and when an installed extension calls a
  classifier-2 `ExtPorts` field while any hook it registers is not excluded** (classifier 2).

**The routing audit is structural first and inventory second, and neither is a reachability
analysis.** An earlier revision required the audit to be "reachability-aware, not textual." That
named a property rather than a buildable analysis, and this repo cannot answer the question it
implies: `tools/code-graph` emits function-to-function edges only
(`INVOKE_FIELDS = ["from_slug", "to_slug", "resolution", "approximate"]`), its parser is regex-based
and self-described as a source-parsed approximation, `ctors.csv` indexes constructor *declarations*
rather than constructor flow, and its default `core` profile is scoped to `src/core` alone —
excluding both `packages/` and `src/core/test/**`, the latter holding `dispatch_step`, `live_ports`,
and `scripted_ports_from_steps`, which are production-executed despite the path. "Can any reachable
caller produce the variant this match arm consumes" is unanswerable from those tables. The
requirement is replaced by three ordered obligations:

1. **Prefer making the defect unrepresentable.** Where a seam admits a dead dispatch arm, narrow the
   type instead of auditing the arm. This is the fix that actually resolved the motivating instance:
   `89a1d67` retyped `C2LoopState.provider` from `StepProvider` to `Ports` and deleted the
   unreachable `LiveAI`/`Scripted` branches, converting a runtime invariant into a compile-time fact
   strictly stronger than any audit this gate could run. A profile may not cite an audit where
   narrowing was available and declined.
2. **For the residual ambient-effect inventory, use a conservative textual inventory of
   ambient-effect imports and call names, per in-profile module, at *site* granularity.** Its profile
   roots are stated explicitly and cover **`src` and `packages`**, including production code under
   `src/core/test/**`. Any ambient import, or any call name it cannot resolve to a routed seam, is a
   fail-closed candidate for manual triage. Over-approximation is the correct bias: an inventory that
   reports more candidate ambient sites than exist forces routing work, which fails closed.

   **The detector is textual by decision, not by default, and the call-graph is explicitly rejected
   for this use.** Two earlier revisions got this wrong in opposite directions and both are recorded
   because the reasoning matters more than the conclusion. The first required a "reachability-aware,
   not textual" audit — a property, not a buildable analysis. The second recommended a
   conservatively over-approximate *function-level call-graph* audit and justified it by claiming
   `tools/code-graph` drops calls through function-valued seams. Both are wrong:

   - The dropped call that claim rests on — `_resolve_call`
     (`tools/code-graph/extractor/source_parser.py:176-199`) discarding `ports.model_step(...)`
     because `ports` is a local binding rather than an import alias — is a **routed** seam call, which
     is precisely the case that *should* be absent from an ambient inventory. The parser resolves
     direct ambient calls through its bare-import path, so `now()` under `import std/clock (now)` is
     seen. That drop never established a fail-open.
   - The real disqualifiers are scope and granularity. `PROFILES["core"]` is `("src/core",)` and never
     contained `packages/` (`tools/code-graph/extractor/config.py:13-17`), so a `core`-scoped audit —
     even with `--include-tests` — misses every extension-package site, including the eight
     `motoko-ext-compose` clock reads the bullet above makes a conformance precondition. And the
     emitted rows are not sites: the plain-call path dedups on `(from_slug, std_module, symbol)`
     while the interpolation path carries no `seen` check, so N ambient calls in one function may
     collapse to one row or emit several. An audit that cannot count sites cannot certify routing
     *completeness*, which is exactly what D4's all-or-nothing rule needs.

   **There are two classifiers, and a profile needs both.** The first covers ambient stdlib effects;
   the second covers ABI port fields that do not yet carry the world token. Neither sees what the
   other sees, and specifying only the first is what left D1's extension-model-path rule without a
   detector.

   ***Classifier 1 — effect-bearing target modules. Built, not specified.***
   `tools/effect-inventory/derive.py`, run by `make effect_inventory`. **This obligation was
   rewritten four times in prose and found fail-open every time; it is now a program, and the
   program is the specification.** What the ADR fixes is the *contract*, not the implementation:

   - **The detection set is the union of two derivations** — the builtin projection
     (`ailang builtins list -json`, `is_pure == false`, project `module`) and a parsed scan of the
     pinned stdlib source. Neither alone is sufficient: on the pin the union is 25 modules, of which
     `std/extension` and `std/sem` are **source-only**, and `std/sem` is reached from
     `src/core/rpc.ail:200` at `! {SharedMem}`. A builtin-only classifier certifies a clean routing
     inventory over that read.
   - **The gate is the reconciliation, not the derivation.** Every `std/*` module imported under the
     in-profile roots must be in the union or *proven* effect-free by both derivations. Anything else
     fails closed. On the pin: 21 imported, 13 effect-bearing, 8 proven effect-free, 0 unresolved.
   - **The derived set is toolchain-specific.** It is recorded with the profile or execution manifest
     alongside the resolved scan-root commit, and the tool refuses to run when the scan root and the
     executing compiler disagree. Re-derivation is a required step of every repin.
   - **Soundness boundary**, unchanged and still load-bearing: it sees literal ambient imports and
     call names inside the scanned AILANG tree; it does **not** see effects performed outside that
     tree (TypeScript children, MCP subprocesses, shelled binaries); it does **not** decide
     reachability — it enumerates sites and the profile decides scope (D4); and it does **not** reach
     AILANG source outside the scan roots, so a profile installing a registry-resolved package must
     extend the roots through the resolved lock graph or fail validation closed.
   - **Where a parsed interface cannot be produced, a signature-scoped textual fallback runs and the
     file is never skipped**, because a skipped file is a silent fail-open. `make
     effect_inventory_selftest` cross-validates that fallback against `ailang iface` on every file
     where both run — currently 43 of 44 agree, 0 disagree — and that cross-check is what licenses
     the fallback. The remaining file, `std/secret.ail`, fails `MOD010` and is resolved textually.

   The traps that produced four failed specifications are encoded in the tool at the point each
   matters, and are recorded here only so they are not re-derived: `effects` is the sole membership
   input and `pure` contradicts it; module ids come from the path relative to the scan root, not
   `iface`'s own `module` field; only the declaration's result row decides membership, never a
   parameter's; effect variables are not effects; the walk is recursive; and the tool refuses to run
   from a temporary directory, where AILANG auto-relaxes `MOD010` and hides the one real failure.

   ***Classifier 2 — `ExtPorts` fields that drop a cursor D1 requires threaded.*** The membership
   criterion is: **a field whose call is the extension-side entry to a core seam that D1 requires to
   thread successor state, and which cannot return it.** Today that is exactly **`ai_step`**, because
   `Ports.model_step`'s successor is the only cursor D1 currently demands and `ExtPorts.ai_step`
   returns `Result[string, string]`. Inventory its **call sites** across every in-profile
   source root.

   **`clock_now`, `proc_exec`, and `env_get` are explicitly *not* members**, and saying so is
   load-bearing rather than tidy. An earlier revision defined the set as "fields that do not yet
   return world state", which selects all four — and under that reading the clock bullet above becomes
   self-defeating: it *requires* a `compose` profile to route its eight reads **into**
   `ExtPorts.clock_now`, which the rejection rule would then reject six lines later. Those three
   fields lose no cursor. They are point reads and effect crossings that the world protocol will
   eventually mediate, but nothing in the interim depends on them returning successor state, so they
   are routing destinations rather than rejection triggers.

   The set is therefore one field today and grows only when D1 requires another cursor threaded
   through an extension-side entry. It does not "retire field by field": it is retired **once**, by
   the single world-token ABI major that *Consequences* budgets, and an earlier revision's
   field-by-field phrasing implied a schedule that does not exist.

   **Amendment, 2026-08-03 (WI-A4 implemented). The set is THREE fields, not one, and the two
   paragraphs above name the wrong non-members.** The criterion is correct and unchanged. What
   changed is the world it selects over: WI-A12 state-threaded `Ports.tool_exec` and `Ports.env_get`,
   and the escape clause directly above — "grows only when D1 requires another cursor threaded
   through an extension-side entry" — is exactly the event that fired.

   Applying the criterion at HEAD, mechanically, per field:

   | `ExtPorts` field | core seam it fronts | seam threads a successor | ext field can return it | verdict |
   |---|---|---|---|---|
   | `ai_step` | `Ports.model_step` | yes, `ProviderExchange.next_state` | no — `Result[string, string]` | **member** |
   | `proc_exec` | `Ports.tool_exec` | yes, `ToolExecution.next_state` | no — `string` | **member** |
   | `env_get` | `Ports.env_get` | yes, `EnvRead.next_state` | no — `string` | **member** |
   | `clock_now` | none | n/a | n/a | **unrouted, not a member** |

   The bridge is `session.ext_ports_of`, and the two new members drop their successors in one line
   each: `session.ail:764` takes `.value` off an `EnvRead`, `session.ail:780` takes `.outcome` off a
   `ToolExecution`. **A discarded `ToolExecution.next_state` is not different in kind from a
   discarded `ProviderExchange.next_state`** — same cursor, same ABI edge, same loss — and no reading
   of the criterion distinguishes them.

   **`clock_now` remains a non-member, and the paragraph above reaches that answer by the wrong
   route.** It is not that the field "loses no cursor" — `Ports.clock_now` returns a
   `ClockReading` carrying `next_state`, so there is a cursor there to lose. It is that the
   extension-side seam **never reaches that port at all**: `ext_unrouted_clock` performs an ambient
   `now()` (`session.ail:796`), so the field is not the entry to a core seam and the criterion's
   first conjunct is unsatisfied. That is a worse condition than membership, not a better one, and it
   is deliberate — plan rule S2 chose a loud ambient read over a silently frozen snapshot because
   `ExtPorts.clock_now`'s zero-argument shape admits no world capture. **The instrument that covers
   it is the `Clock` poison probe, not this classifier**, and the two must not be confused.

   **The self-defeat argument the original paragraph was protecting still holds, and this amendment
   does not disturb it.** The rejected earlier definition — "fields that do not yet return world
   state" — selects all four including `clock_now`, which would make the clock bullet require a
   `compose` profile to route its eight reads into a field the rejection rule then rejects. The
   criterion selects three and excludes `clock_now`, so `clock_now` stays a routing destination.
   The correction is to the enumeration, not to the rule that produced it.

   **Exposure is nil and no conformant profile changes.** Membership only bites through the
   extension-granularity rule, and that rule fires on *calls*. At this revision the only classifier-2
   call sites in `src` + `packages` are the two known `ai_step` sites; there are zero calls to
   `proc_exec`, `env_get` or `clock_now` outside the ABI package itself. All fourteen checked-in
   configurations install `compaction_ai`, which already calls `ai_step`, so every one of them was
   already subject to the rule and none moves. **This is a wording correction, not a scope change** —
   checked deliberately before amending, because if it had moved a configuration it would have been
   the plan's decision to make, not this ADR's.

   **What made the stale enumeration dangerous was not that it was wrong — it is that a classifier
   built to it would have been structurally unable to notice.** A detector carrying a hardcoded
   member list reports a clean routing audit over a dropped world cursor the moment an extension
   touches `proc_exec` or `env_get`: it fails *open*, which is the exact defect classifier 1 was
   respecified four times to avoid. So the correction is carried by the tool rather than by this
   paragraph: `tools/ext_call_inventory/derive.py` **re-derives membership from the criterion on
   every run** — reading the `ExtPorts` record, the `Ports` record and the bridge — and never
   consults a list, including this table. The table above is this amendment reporting the tool's
   output, not the tool's input. `make ext_call_inventory_selftest` pins the current answer as a
   regression guard, so the ABI major (WI-B2) changing it goes red rather than passing silently.

   ***Classifier 2's own matcher boundary*** — it does not inherit classifier 1's wholesale, because
   an ABI-field scan and a module-import scan fail differently. The shared limits are the fixed
   `src` + `packages` roots and the refusal to decide reachability. Its own limits: a field reached
   through a **local alias, a re-export, a wrapper function, or a computed field access** is not seen.
   Nothing at HEAD does any of these — the only two `ai_step` **call sites** are
   `packages/motoko-ext-compaction-ai/compaction_ai.ail:106` and
   `packages/motoko_ext_conformance/fixtures/reject_fixtures.ail:90` — and nothing prevents them, so
   an unresolved or indirect field access is a fail-closed candidate for manual triage rather than a
   pass.

   **Re-deriving both classifiers is a required step of every toolchain repin**, tied to the
   ABI-major milestone *Consequences* already budgets, and both derived sets are recorded with the
   profile or its execution manifest so a later reader can tell what was scanned. Neither is wired
   into CI today, which is acceptable only because the repin is itself a sequenced milestone and
   because D5's routing audit is not citable as gate evidence until it is verified.

   **Match on the imported target module, not on bound symbol names.** Aliased and qualified forms
   typecheck on the pin — `import std/clock as c` followed by `c.now()` compiles clean — so a
   name-matching inventory would miss them by construction. Target-module matching covers the bare,
   aliased, and qualified forms together. Nothing at HEAD uses an alias for `std/clock`, which is why
   this has cost nothing so far and is exactly why it must be specified rather than assumed.

   **Soundness boundary, stated because the gate cites it.** Three limits, all load-bearing and none
   closed by this ADR:

   - It does **not** see effects performed outside the scanned AILANG tree — TypeScript child
     processes, MCP subprocesses, shelled binaries.
   - It does **not** decide reachability. It enumerates sites; the profile decides which are in scope
     (D4).
   - It does **not** reach AILANG source outside the `src` + `packages` roots. A registry dependency
     is the live case: `ailang.toml:9` declares `sunholo/logging` resolved from the registry rather
     than a path, so its AILANG source sits under neither root. Exposure today is nil — the only
     importer is an out-of-profile example — but the gate is the point. **A profile must either
     extend the roots through the resolved lock graph for every AILANG package it installs, or fail
     validation closed when an installed package's source lies outside the scanned roots.**

   Effects reached through an `ExtPorts` or `Ports` closure are **covered**, and this is worth stating
   because the previous two attempts at this obligation both turned on confusing it: the closure is
   written literally at a site inside its defining module, so a site-granularity scan over `src` +
   `packages` sees it. What the scan cannot follow is the *call edge*, which an ambient inventory does
   not need.

   This is a different use than the one that failed in F2 — there a textual scan was asked *which
   seam is live*, a question over-approximation answers wrongly, and it certified
   `std/ai.stepWithStream` as the live provider seam when the only hit was an unreachable ADT branch
   (the same was true of `tools_with_extensions(rt)` and `system_prompt_cache_breakpoint()`).
   Architecture discovery and hermeticity inventory are not the same detector and must not share a
   justification.

   **The successor detector is declared-versus-performed effect-row reconciliation**, which is
   compiler-checked and cannot silently rot as a textual scan can. It is not available today:
   `src/core/agents_md.ail:106` declares `walk_agents` with no effect row while calling `fileExists`,
   a live `FS` under-declaration that pinned v0.26.0 accepts. Closing that class of gap, and the
   reconciliation gate itself, belong to the implementation plan.
3. **If constructor-level reachability is ever genuinely required**, specify the analysis, its
   soundness boundary, its profile roots, and its fail-closed behavior *before* naming it as
   name-adoption gate evidence. Nothing in this ADR currently requires it.

Test-only code may:

- generate and decode programs;
- implement the deterministic world;
- collect replay metadata; and
- evaluate invariants.

It may not reimplement state transitions, recovery policy, tool-history construction, compaction,
or finalization.

Fixed scenarios and pure property tests may continue using narrower entry points. Their existence
does not satisfy this decision unless the generated DST axis drives the real traced session.

### D6. Every run returns one complete terminal trace

The DST runner returns one of two disjoint result classes:

```text
SystemRun {
  outcome,
  ledger_trace,
  interaction_log,
  replay_metadata
}

HarnessFailure {
  kind,
  interaction_position,
  actual_request_projection,
  partial_ledger_trace,
  replay_metadata
}
```

The exact representation may reuse existing types, but the contract is:

1. Every `SystemRun`, whether successful or failed, has exactly one canonical `RunSummary` record in
   `ledger_trace`; it is the final record for the established run. **The starting count at HEAD is
   zero on every terminal path, not one on some.** Every terminal summary routes through
   `emit_run_summary` (`src/core/session.ail:833`, five call sites at `1325`, `1554`, `1704`, `1711`,
   `1762`, of which `1325` is a shared error-return helper reached from several terminal paths), and
   that function's only ledger operation is `ledger_emit` — which is an effectful *projection*,
   `-> () ! {IO, Trace}` at `src/core/session.ail:290`, not an append. The pure function that builds
   the returned trace is `ledger_append` (`src/core/phase_vocab.ail:557`), and no terminal path calls
   it with a `RunSummary`. The returned `LedgerTrace` therefore contains no `RunSummary` on any path.
   That is the exact case item 4 warns about, true of the entire driver
   today rather than of a hypothetical future event. The spike confirmed the requirement is
   reachable without restructuring the driver — routing all seven through one finalization point that
   emits the projection *and* appends the same record was sufficient — but the plan should treat this
   as unimplemented everywhere rather than partially satisfied.

   **Amendment, 2026-08-02 (WI-A9 implemented; `ff8d8e5`).** The conclusion above held exactly — the
   returned trace contained no `RunSummary` on any path — but **the account of *why* was incomplete,
   and an implementer working from the five call sites alone would have left two terminal paths
   unfinalized.** There are **seven terminal returns**, not five: invalid history (`c2_step_state`
   `Err`) and the internal approval failure (`AwaitApproval` with no pending approval) emitted **no
   `run_summary` at all**, not even a projection, so they appear at no `emit_run_summary` call site.
   Both now route through the single finalizer. The general lesson, recorded because it will recur:
   **when an item rewrites a class of returns, enumerate the class, not the helper's callers.**
2. A typed internal termination reason maps exhaustively to the wire `finish_reason`. The
   implementation must derive this list from reachable terminal returns rather than preserve the
   current integer-code helper or stale labels.

   **Amendment, 2026-08-02 (WI-A9 implemented; `ff8d8e5`).** An earlier revision enumerated the
   reasons as "success, budget exhaustion, maximum steps, compaction exhaustion, provider failure,
   unrecovered tool failure, invalid history, and internal driver failure". Deriving the list from
   reachable terminal returns — as this clause itself requires — **falsifies that enumeration in
   both directions**, at the same count of eight:

   - **`dp7_rejected` was a stale label of exactly the kind this clause warns against.** The retired
     integer helper mapped `2 -> "dp7_rejected"` and **no call site ever passed 2**; a DP7 rejection
     re-injects a user message and the run terminates later via max-steps or budget. Dropped.
   - **Unrecovered tool failure is not a terminal path.** Tool results feed back into the loop as
     messages; no terminal return corresponds to it. No variant was invented for it.
   - **System-prompt-empty is reachable and was absent.** The seal failure `SealSystemPromptEmpty`
     is a genuine terminal return, now `TermSystemPromptEmpty`.

   All eight reachable reasons map onto the existing wire strings, so **no wire-compatibility change
   was required.** One discrimination remains fragile and is assigned to D3's catalogue rather than
   left here: max-steps is separated from internal failure by matching a literal error message,
   because `step_machine.ail` emits the same `Internal` code for both.
3. `DoneEvent` may remain a success event, but it is not a second terminal record. Returned outcome,
   `DoneEvent` when present, and `RunSummary` must agree.
4. Every logical `LedgerEvent` produced by the driver reaches the returned trace, and the obligation
   is **parity**, not a shared transition. Where the substrate permits it, append and project in one
   transition — that is the strongest form and the default. **Stream emissions are the named
   exception where it is not permitted**: the provider callback's closed effect row means projection
   happens during the call and the append happens after it returns, so a single shared transition is
   impossible by construction (D1). For that class the obligation is discharged by an explicitly
   checked invariant instead: the projected sequence and the returned emission log must match
   exactly in order and content, with no duplicate and no omission. Display-only telemetry excluded
   from the ledger is classified separately, by the event-vocabulary artifact below. An external
   `ledger_emit` call is not evidence that the event is in `LedgerTrace`; the returned trace is
   authoritative.
5. Display-only fields such as duration and session id use virtual time or normalization and cannot
   change invariant results.
6. A program mismatch, invalid program, exhausted interaction stream, or forbidden effect is a
   `HarnessFailure`, not a production `RunSummary`. If it occurs after execution begins, the result
   contains the partial trace and actual request projection needed to diagnose it. **This applies to
   violations the runner can observe** — a profile-routing or exclusion violation detected inside the
   runner, which can return a typed value because the driver is still running. It does **not** apply
   to a raw capability bypass: a denied ambient effect terminates evaluation, so no typed result and
   no partial trace can be returned. That case is an expected non-zero run, and the two must not be
   conflated in either the contract or the probes that test it. If both are ever required to return
   the same typed value, an effect-interposition mechanism that preserves the driver-owned partial
   trace must be named and proven on the pinned substrate first; none exists today.
7. Setup failure before the deterministic world and profile are established is also a typed
   `HarnessFailure`; it must not appear as a successful empty trace.
8. Captured console output is diagnostic only.

The implementation should centralize “append to returned trace + emit projection” so new
invariant-bearing events cannot silently update one channel without the other.

**The event vocabulary is a versioned artifact, and it is the fifth recorded axis.** Project 007,
now accepted, records the terminal trace and its wire projection as a maintained compatibility
surface alongside the program schema, generator version, profile version, and execution manifest.
This ADR carries that obligation here rather than leaving it delegated to decisions that do not
mention it. One artifact binds, for every `LedgerEvent` variant:

- the variant itself;
- its wire name;
- its payload schema;
- and its **classification as logical or display-only** — the distinction D6.4 and D7's parity
  invariant both depend on, and which exists nowhere today.

At HEAD the vocabulary has 34 variants whose wire names live in trailing source comments rather
than in a type, and whose consumer is a `switch` in a separate TypeScript process. That is a mapping
which can drift silently, and once the returned trace is the oracle it must not.

**This is new construction, and nothing in the repo is a partial implementation of it.** The one
naming function that exists — `src/core/phase_vocab.ail:561 ledger_record_name` — names **3 of the
34** variants and collapses the other 31 to the literal string `"wire"`. It is not a seed that can be
grown into the artifact; it is a different thing that happens to share a subject. The vertical spike
found this the hard way: its check that the `RunSummary` is the final record in the returned trace
could not be written against `ledger_record_name` and needed a bespoke matcher. The implementation
plan must therefore schedule the artifact as construction with a fail-closed validator, and **must
not schedule any D7 parity invariant or acceptance row that depends on the logical/display-only
classification before the artifact exists** — those checks are undecidable until it does.

**Amendment, 2026-08-02 (WI-A8 implemented; `c873002`). Two things this clause left implicit, both
found by building it.**

*First, the classification must be SEMANTIC, not a survey of what the driver appends today.* Only 13
of the 34 variants reach the returned trace at HEAD. Classifying by current behaviour produces a
complete, cleanly validating artifact that declares 21 events display-only — and D6.4's parity
obligation then becomes vacuous, blessing the exact gap it exists to close. Both readings validate;
the wrong one is silent. The implemented artifact keeps the survey in a separate field and exposes
`logical_variants_not_in_trace()`, which is **15 today** and is D7's work list.

**Amendment, 2026-08-04 (WI-A14 implemented; `00dbdb4`). The `DoneEvent` tension below is RESOLVED,
and the resolution turns on a clause of D6.4 that had been read as a caveat.**

D6.4 says the obligation is **parity, not a shared transition** — in as many words, and it names
stream emissions as the case where a shared transition is impossible by construction. That licenses
separating the append from the projection **at a single site** where the two obligations conflict,
which is exactly `DoneEvent`'s situation. `session.ail`'s `Finalize` arm now appends the `DoneEvent`
**before** `c2_finalize` appends the `RunSummary`, and projects it **after**, unchanged. Four
obligations then hold simultaneously where three could not: D6.4 (a logical event reaches the
returned trace), D6.1 (the summary is still the final appended record), D6.3 (agreement is decidable
over the returned trace alone), and D8 (the wire order `run_summary` then `done` is untouched, so no
compatibility surface moves).

**The alternative is worth recording because it is the one-line wrong answer in its most tempting
form.** Classifying `DoneEvent` as display-only would not merely make D6.4 vacuous for it — it would
make **D6.3 unstatable**, since "display-only ... cannot change invariant results" and D6.3 is an
invariant over precisely this event's content.

**And the separation this decision required of the artifact paid a dividend it did not predict.**
Closing the gap did **not** bump the event-vocabulary version: D8 makes a change to a variant, a wire
name, a payload schema or a **classification** a version change, and `reaches_trace_today` is none of
those four. Had the survey been folded into the classification, closing a parity gap would have been
a compatibility event requiring a decoder for every old trace. `logical_variants_not_in_trace()` is
now **14**, and each remaining entry carries its reason in
`src/core/dst_invariants.parity_gap_reasons()` — externally blocked, unblocked one-line append,
inside the tool-dispatch fold, or unreachable under `driver_only`. The sharpest single line in that
register: `ThinkingStreamStart` reaches the returned trace and `ThinkingStreamEnd` does not, from the
same code path.

*Second, `DoneEvent` does not classify cleanly, and that is a finding about this decision rather than
a judgement call.* D6.3 requires the returned outcome, the `DoneEvent` and the `RunSummary` to
**agree** — an invariant over the `DoneEvent`'s content, which is exactly what "display-only ...
cannot change invariant results" denies. But D6.1 requires the `RunSummary` to be the **final**
record of the returned trace, and the driver projects the `DoneEvent` after `c2_finalize` has
appended it. So D6.4's obligation on a logical event and D6.1's final-record invariant cannot both
be satisfied by appending it where it is emitted. A resolution exists — append the `DoneEvent`
before finalizing — but it changes a terminal path and belongs with D7's invariant set, not with the
vocabulary. The artifact classifies it `Logical` and records the tension in
`classification_findings()`, printed on every run of `make event_vocabulary`, so the classification
is not mistaken for a decision that the append is free.

The artifact is
validated at load and **fails closed on an unclassified variant**, so a new event cannot enter the
ledger without declaring which side of the logical/display-only line it falls on. The preferred form
derives the wire name from the type, making drift a compile error rather than a runtime surprise;
that also makes the inventory regenerable instead of hand-maintained. Its version is recorded in the
execution manifest (D5) and preserved in the failure record (D8), on the same footing as the other
four axes. A change to any variant, wire name, payload schema, or classification is a version
change, and the compatibility rule for old traces is the one D8 applies to old programs: preserve
decoding or pin a runner, never silently reinterpret.

### D7. Invariants are evaluated over the whole execution

The runner applies reusable invariants to the returned outcome and complete trace. At minimum, the
name-adoption gate requires:

- exactly one final `RunSummary` for every `SystemRun`, and none synthesized for a harness failure;
- parity between all logical ledger emissions and returned trace records;
- legal phase/state transitions;
- valid tool-call/tool-result pairing, including denial and failure paths;
- monotonically valid budget/cost accounting;
- bounded retry and progress behavior under the modeled fault catalogue;
- checkpoint/compaction history invariants already owned by the framework;
- agreement between returned outcome and terminal summary;
- strict-replay request equality, safe regression-replay compatibility, and complete interaction
  consumption;
- valid logical-world transitions, including declared commit/no-commit behavior under faults;
- monotonic virtual time and deadline derivation; and
- zero discovery-generator failures, matcher mismatches, forbidden effects, and ambient RNG reads.

The discovery contract is itself an invariant: under the same execution manifest/profile,
`(schema_version, generator_id, generator_version, seed, initial_world)` run twice must produce the
same resolved program, interaction log, outcome, and normalized trace.

Example-based assertions remain useful, but a generated run that checks only its final prose or a
golden snapshot is not the new DST axis.

Liveness claims must be bounded and operational—for example, “terminates or reaches a named retry
bound within N decisions”—rather than relying on an unbounded test run.

### D8. Replay records the program, not just the seed

Every generated failure reports and preserves:

- execution-program schema version;
- stable generator id/family;
- generator version;
- seed;
- the exact serialized program;
- source revision and AILANG/toolchain version;
- the named profile plus its exact execution manifest;
- the event-vocabulary version under which the trace was written (D6), without which the trace's
  wire names and logical/display-only classifications cannot be interpreted later;
- the normalized run configuration and policy/model-registry inputs needed to interpret it;
- the first failed invariant;
- the terminal outcome; and
- the normalized trace or a stable location containing it.

Replay consumes the exact program and does not regenerate it. This keeps historical failures valid
when generator distributions, draw order, or ranges change.

Programs use a deterministic, diffable encoding with an explicit compatibility policy. The
implementation plan may select the encoding and storage path, but CI output must provide a
copy-pasteable local replay command or artifact reference.

Any change to the PRNG algorithm, draw order, generator ranges, boundary strategy, or default
initial world that can remap a seed requires a generator-version change. A pinned generator canary
for each stable generator id must fail if such a remap occurs without that bump.

The reproducibility promise is precise:

- Repeating discovery under the recorded execution manifest/profile and seed must reproduce the same
  resolved program.
- Under the recorded execution manifest/profile, the exact program must reproduce the same normalized
  interaction log, terminal outcome, and trace.
- Under a newer revision, the program remains the same regression input, but a changed outcome or
  trace may be the intended evidence that a bug was fixed. Compatibility-aware regression mode may
  continue across recorded request-projection differences, but stops on unsafe causal mismatch.
  Replay does not promise identical output across code changes.
- A schema migration must either preserve old-program decoding or provide a pinned runner/artifact;
  silently reinterpreting an old program is forbidden.

Programs contain synthetic values only. Environment maps and interaction artifacts must reject or
redact secret-shaped/live credentials before persistence. Large exact payloads may live in a CI
artifact addressed by digest; a digest without retained bytes is not sufficient for replay.

Shrinking operates on programs, not only seeds, preserves request causality and schema validity, and
revalidates the failure after every reduction. It may land after the first name-adoption gate if the
project records that deferral explicitly, but replay of the unshrunk failing program is not
optional.

### D9. The simulator is sequential until the production contract changes

The deterministic world consumes one expected interaction at a time at production effect
boundaries and threads one explicit world state. It does not add a concurrent scheduler for the
current agent loop.

This decision must be revisited before introducing parallel ledger-affecting tools, ledger-sharing
subagents, state-mutating background callbacks, or independently state-advancing stream handlers.
At that point, reproducibility may require explicit actor identities, runnable sets, and
seed-selected interleavings. Adding concurrency without revisiting this ADR invalidates the
simulation model.

### D10. Existing tests remain, and naming changes only at the conformance gate

Fixed deterministic scenarios, seeded scalar PBT, conformance tests, and live-provider smokes test
different things and remain valuable. The new axis complements them.

During implementation, new code and targets use a non-simulation working name. The unqualified
“DST”/“simulation” label is adopted for the generated axis only after the acceptance test below
passes for a documented baseline profile and the project-007 definition/taxonomy ADR is accepted.
Every report names the profile; additional profiles earn coverage separately.

Existing historical target names are handled by the taxonomy ADR’s grandfathering decision; this
ADR does not broaden that exception.

### D11. Search is a first-class gate, not a collection of fixed seeds

The generated axis has two complementary corpora:

1. a blocking PR corpus containing fixed seeds and exact promoted regression programs; and
2. a scheduled rotating corpus whose seed window changes deterministically and is reported.

Every run reports generator id/version, attempted seeds, completed `SystemRun` count,
harness/generator failures, fault classes reached, **named recovery branches reached**, waived fault
classes with their waiving conditions, terminal reasons reached, and elapsed budget. Class-reached
and branch-reached are separate counters read from D3's catalogue artifact: reaching a fault class
is not evidence that the production branch it targets was executed, and only the second is the
coverage the acceptance test asks for. PR
and scheduled jobs each declare an operator-accepted minimum seed count; the gate asserts that
exact count completed. A zero, silently truncated, or below-minimum window fails. The fixed coverage
bank must collectively reach every required fault class that the profile does not waive, and each
waiver must be declared per D3; rotating search expands beyond it. A
scheduled failure retains its exact resolved program **together with the execution manifest it ran
under** and is promoted to the fixed regression corpus before or with the fix. The two travel as one
artifact. D8's reproducibility promise is conditioned on the recorded manifest and profile, so a
program promoted without one is not a reproduction unit — it is a program nobody can state the
meaning of. A corpus member whose manifest is stale or unresolvable is not silently reinterpreted:
strict replay fails closed, and regression replay may proceed only with the difference recorded.

The implementation plan selects seed counts, rotation, retention, and sharding from measured CI
cost. Parallel workers run independent world states and programs; this is search parallelism, not
multi-actor simulation inside one run.

## Gate mechanisms: built, and deferred

This ADR names five detection/validation mechanisms. It is scoped to the detector layer: D3's fault
catalogue and D6's event vocabulary are deferred constructed artifacts too, with fail-closed
acceptance contracts stated in their own decisions, but they are architecture components rather than
hermeticity/coverage detectors and are tracked there rather than here. **One is built; four are
deferred to the
implementation plan behind the acceptance criteria below, and this section is the boundary between
"the ADR decides it" and "the plan builds it."**

The distinction matters because it was ignored for eight review rounds. A mechanism whose prose
specification has been rewritten twice and is still found unsound is not under-specified — it is in
the wrong artifact. Prose cannot establish that a scan is sound; only running it can. The four
mechanisms this section originally listed had collectively been rewritten thirteen times, and the one
that was finally built was correct on its first run and immediately produced a fact four prose
revisions had missed. **The fifth row, classifier 3, was added on 2026-08-06 and the same discipline
binds it: its criterion below is what it must run and report, not what it must be specified to do.**

| Mechanism | State | Acceptance criterion |
|---|---|---|
| **Classifier 1** — effect-bearing stdlib module set | **Built, and passing a criterion that no longer certifies what it was written to certify** (see the qualification below this table): `tools/effect-inventory/derive.py`, `make effect_inventory` | **AMENDED 2026-08-06, by both acceptance reviewers.** Exits 0 on the profile's roots with zero unresolved modules; the derived set and scan-root commit are recorded in the manifest; and `make effect_inventory_selftest` reports zero disagreements **over a comparison set covering at least 90% of the stdlib modules the profile's roots import — a self-test that compares fewer is a FAILURE, whatever it agrees about**. The first two clauses and the old third are met at the v0.33.0 pin (`agree=1 disagree=0`, 1 of 46 modules compared); **the coverage clause is not**. Met in full at `a0d4edb`, run by both acceptance reviewers: 0 unresolved, `agree=43 disagree=0` |
| **Classifier 2** — `ExtPorts` typed-call inventory | Deferred | A type-aware field-call inventory over the in-profile roots, failing closed on every alias, wrapper, re-export, or computed access it cannot resolve. `grep -rn '\.ai_step('` is its conservative approximation, not its definition |
| **Site-to-hook attribution table** | Deferred | Produced source-global with a per-row named reviewer; profile-load validation rejects unknown hook ids, stale bindings and malformed rows; necessity is manually reviewed and that is a **stated exception** to the automated-gate promise until the interprocedural validator exists |
| **Coverage floor validation** | Deferred | Profile load rejects any installed extension with zero covered hooks, and any installed extension with an unconditionally-dispatched hook excluded. The carve-out and its reverse check are gone — the configuration they blessed cannot execute (D5) — so this no longer depends on classifier 2 |
| **Classifier 3** — extension-closure ambient-effect inventory (ADMITTED 2026-08-06 as the fourth deferred mechanism) | Deferred | A structural import-and-call-name inventory over an installed extension's **transitive module closure**, deciding per effect whether the call that performs it is a field call on an `ExtPorts`-typed value. All four properties of the [amended criterion-2 passage](#adr-criterion-2-evidentiary-basis) are required, and three of them are what this criterion adds to obligation 2 clause 2: the unit is the **extension closure**, not the file; classification is **symbol-granular**, not module-granular; and every alias, wrapper, re-export, computed access, unannotated `export func` and effect-*variable* row it cannot resolve to a concrete answer is an **UNRESOLVED rejection, not a pass**. It must therefore be built on per-symbol effect data from the compiler — `.ailang/cache/compile/modules/*/iface.json` (`ailang.iface/v1`) or `ailang iface` stdout — and **not** on a per-declaration textual parse. Accepted when it runs over all fifteen registrable extensions, reports its producer and that producer's revision per extension, and its rejection discipline is fixture-tested on each of the five unresolvable shapes. **Yield, which is what this instrument is worth and is stated here rather than in a note: 4 of 15 extensions — `decision_framework`, `compaction_structural`, `empty_stop_guard`, `progress_contract_guard` — and 4 only on a compiler-derived producer. On the textual route the same fail-closed discipline yields 1 of 15**, because `std/json.jo` carries no row and three of those four import it |

**QUALIFICATION on Classifier 1's row — REVISED 2026-08-06 by both acceptance reviewers, replacing
the qualification WI-D10 recorded.** WI-D10 flagged its edit to this cell for ratification rather than
burying it, which was right; the flag is what caused this measurement, and **the measurement does not
reproduce.**

WI-D10 and the amendment review before it recorded that all 46 `ailang iface` calls fail `MOD010`,
that the self-test reports `agree=0 disagree=0`, and that it exits non-zero with *"a pass-shaped
absence, not a pass."* Re-measured at HEAD on the same v0.33.0 pin, from the repository root, four
consecutive runs:

```text
make effect_inventory           EXIT 0   INTERFACE FAILURES (45), not 46 -- std/env alone resolves
                                         21 imported std/* modules, ZERO unresolved
                                         13 effect-bearing, 8 proven effect-free
make effect_inventory_selftest  EXIT 0   self-test: agree=1 disagree=0
```

So classifier 1's criterion **as it was written is met at HEAD, in both clauses**, and that is worse
than the red WI-D10 reported. The guard in `tools/effect-inventory/derive.py` is
`if agree + disagree == 0`, a **zero-check, not a coverage check**: exactly one comparable stdlib
module out of forty-six converts a pass-shaped absence into a literal pass, and both targets go
green. The self-test agreed with itself about 2.2% of the surface it exists to validate. Every other
module classification still comes from the unvalidated textual fallback, exactly as reported — only
now nothing says so.

**The defect is therefore in the criterion, not only in the tool, and amending an acceptance
criterion in this table is ours.** The criterion now carries a coverage clause (≥90% of the imported
stdlib modules compared), which is the clause that was missing when the tool was accepted at
`a0d4edb` with `agree=43`, and whose absence is why a regression to `agree=1` reads as a pass.
Against the amended criterion classifier 1 is **failing**, and it blocks the name.

**Two corrections to the record, made rather than inherited.** The count is **45 of 46** interface
failures, not 46 of 46; and the self-test's failure exit is **1**, not 2 — `derive.py` returns 1 for
that path and reserves 2 for harness error. Both numbers were carried forward across three documents
without being re-run. Running them from a directory under `/tmp` instead reports `agree=46
disagree=0`, because AILANG auto-relaxes `MOD010` inside a temp directory — `derive.py`'s own
docstring warns about this, and it is why the repository root is the only legitimate cwd for either
target. **Why `std/env` alone resolves is an AILANG-side question and is an addendum owed to the
existing `MOD010` filing, not a finding against this tree.**

**No row was removed or reordered; classifier 3's row was added and classifier 1's State and criterion
cells were revised.** The qualification lives here rather than in the amendment body because a status
table that reads "Built and independently verified" against a mechanism certifying nothing is the
artifact a future reader will trust — and a green gate makes that failure mode strictly harder to
catch than the red one WI-D10 found. **Repairing classifier 1 against the amended criterion is owed
and unowned, and putting both targets into `make dst` is its precondition**: a gate outside the
aggregate target degrades invisibly whether it fails loudly or passes vacuously.

**None of the four deferred mechanisms blocks acceptance of this ADR.** They block the *name*: D5's
routing audit is not citable as name-adoption gate evidence until each is built and passes its
criterion above. **Classifier 1 blocks the name too**, on the coverage clause added above — so the
name turns on five mechanisms, of which four are unbuilt and one is built and failing. That is a
finite, checkable list, and it is deliberately not the same thing as "this correction pass has not
been independently verified" — a condition that regenerates with every edit and can therefore never
be discharged.

### The architecture test, applied to classifier 3 by both acceptance reviewers, 2026-08-06

Recorded in full because a test inherited is a test not run, and because the amendment review's
application of it is evidence, not authority. Both reviewers applied
*"if this mechanism turned out unbuildable, would D1–D11 still be the right architecture?"*
independently, on two different arms.

**First arm — what in D1–D11 would have to change. Nothing, and the counterfactual is already the
observed state.** Absent classifier 3, criterion 2's text is unchanged, the interim declared-row rule
is unchanged, and D5's contract, floor, disclosure and fail-closed exclusion rule all stand. HEAD
*is* the classifier-3-absent world: barrier count derived at **3** (`on_pre_step`,
`on_response_intercept`, `on_solver_candidate`), `driver_only` installs nothing, and there are zero
classification entries in the tree. The architecture was accepted in that state and does not depend
on leaving it. **Yes.**

**Second arm — is the degradation conservative, and what carries it.** Absent classifier 3, no
extension becomes installable and no profile may record `WorldMediated` on a measured basis, so the
cost is *coverage*, not *correctness* — the same direction as classifier 2 and the attribution table,
and the opposite of coverage-floor validation, which is the one deferred mechanism whose failure is
fail-open. **Yes — but not for free, and this is the condition the reviewers attach rather than
inherit.** The fail-closed default is prose: `classification_agrees`
(`src/core/dst_profile.ail:893-910`) validates a `WorldMediated` entry against the excluded-id list
and against nothing else, and `HookClassificationEntry` has no `basis` field. What actually makes
classifier 3's absence conservative is the **barrier count being derived rather than asserted**. If
an ABI change ever cleared the barriers while `basis` were still absent, classifier 3's absence would
stop degrading conservatively and start licensing an unevidenced claim. **The admission is therefore
granted on the condition that `basis` lands with or before any change that lowers the barrier
count** — whichever comes first, and neither is classifier 3's builder's to skip.

**Disposition: ADMITTED as the fourth deferred mechanism, unanimously, with that one condition.** The
escalation branch does not fire: the extension model is *uncovered*, not uncoverable by construction,
because what stops a measurably-effect-free hook from declaring what it performs is the ABI record's
**closed row**, not the classifier layer. Verified from the compiler's own interface data rather than
from the review's probes: `ExtensionHooks.on_pre_step` carries the concrete label set
`{AI, IO, Trace}` with **no row variable**, `on_response_intercept` `{Clock, FS, IO, Process}`, and
`on_solver_candidate` `{Process}` — closed rows a named binding cannot narrow. That is an ABI change,
and it already sits inside the deferred `motoko-ext-abi` major.

**What the reviewers re-derived rather than accepted.** The 4-of-15 yield was reproduced from source
at admission: fifteen extensions resolved through `ailang.toml` rather than by directory-name
convention, transitive closures of 2–17 modules, **zero unresolved imports**, and exactly
`decision_framework`, `compaction_structural`, `empty_stop_guard`, `progress_contract_guard` clean.
The producer-conditioning in the row is new and is the reviewers' own: `std/json` exports 38 symbols
of which **33 carry no effect row at all**, one of them `jo`, which `compaction_structural`,
`empty_stop_guard` and `progress_contract_guard` all import. On the textual route those are
UNRESOLVED and all three are refused, leaving `decision_framework` alone — **1 of 15**. The
compiler's cached interface answers `jo` positively (`purity: true`, empty effect row), which is why
the criterion above requires a compiler-derived producer. **The consequence is worth stating plainly:
the cheapest producer would have destroyed the result the amendment names as the cheapest path to
non-zero coverage.**

**What acceptance of this ADR turns on is the architecture** — D1's world boundary and state
threading, D2's discovery/replay split, D3's fault-as-outcome rule, D4's single virtual clock, D5's
profile contract, D6's single terminal trace, D7–D11 — plus the one external prerequisite below. Every
one of those has been re-derived and confirmed by every review round since the F1–F6 verifications,
and none has been reopened in eight rounds.

**The external prerequisite is unchanged and is the only thing on the critical path this project
cannot route around:** the upstream recorded-stream API must land in a released AILANG, the toolchain
must be repinned to it, and D1's positive integration probe must pass. A fork prototype does not
satisfy it.

## Acceptance test for the name

A reviewer can approve the generated axis as **Motoko single-actor, logical-fault DST** only when
all answers below are supported by an automated gate, **with one declared exception**: attribution
necessity (D4 clause 3) rests on a recorded named reviewer until the interprocedural validator exists.
A profile may instead take the fully automated route — classify every core effect site as
unconditional core and forgo the attribution table — at the cost of more routing work.

| Question | Required evidence |
|---|---|
| Does one seed generate an execution rather than only values? | At multiple real effect requests, the seeded world chooses responses/faults/latencies that influence subsequent production requests; discovery has zero unexpected harness failures and records the resolved interaction sequence. |
| Is there a modeled logical environment? | Provider, typed tool execution, approval, synthetic environment, runtime randomness if used, clock, and profile-declared logical resource state flow through one explicit state-threaded world with checked transition semantics. |
| Is the tested boundary honest? | The result names the execution manifest and profile; every profile-reachable hook is effect-free, world-mediated, or explicitly excluded; excluded hooks and adapter/parser boundaries are listed; dispatch to an exclusion fails closed; profile-definition validation found no installed extension that calls a classifier-2 `ExtPorts` field while registering an un-excluded hook (D5 classifier 2); every installed extension covers at least one hook (the coverage floor, which binds unconditionally); no installed extension has an unconditionally-dispatched hook excluded; and the result reports per-extension covered/excluded hook **ids**, so a profile covering only ABI-pure no-op slots is visible as such. |
| Do injected faults reach production recovery code? | A bounded seed corpus generated by the real generator reaches and replays every required fault class the profile does not waive, together with its mapped production branch, evidenced by D11's branch-reached counters read from D3's catalogue; every waived class is named with its waiving condition. |
| Does virtual time matter? | Every time-bearing read reachable in the profile is routed through the world clock — no residual direct `std/clock` read survives the routing audit — and two replayable programs holding non-time inputs constant but changing generated latency/clock movement produce the expected completion-versus-timeout or equivalent deadline result without invoking an OS timeout. |
| Is production logic under test? | The runner calls the real traced session driver with threaded world state; no test transition loop computes state-machine decisions or history. |
| Is the oracle complete? | Every enumerated `SystemRun` terminal path returns exactly one final `RunSummary`; all logical ledger emissions appear in the returned trace and all D7 invariants pass. |
| Are harness failures separate? | Deliberate mismatch and in-runner routing/exclusion probes return typed `HarnessFailure` with partial evidence and no synthetic production summary; raw capability-bypass poison probes fail the run non-zero, which is the expected and distinct outcome for that class. |
| Are discovery and replay stable? | Repeated discovery with the same seed produces the same resolved program; exact-program replay reproduces its interaction log and normalized trace under the recorded execution manifest/profile without invoking the generator. |
| Is hermeticity enforced? | Generate and execute phases run under declared capabilities; probes show ambient effect, host-env, clock, and RNG bypasses fail or are detected for the baseline profile. |
| Is there actual search? | PR and rotating scheduled corpora complete their declared minimum counts, the fixed bank reaches every required non-waived fault class, class-reached and branch-reached counters are reported, and exact counterexample programs are retained/promoted with their manifests. |

Passing only the current seeded scalar families, replaying only a seed, normalizing timestamps, or
adding fault-shaped constructors without reaching recovery behavior fails this acceptance test.

## Alternatives considered

### Extend `ScriptedStep` with fault variants

Rejected as the complete architecture. `ScriptedStep` currently describes successful model results;
it does not control approval input, typed tool execution, time, terminal tracing, or explicit world
state. It may be migrated into the provider-outcome portion of `ExecutionProgram`, but cannot
represent the whole world by itself.

### Keep the current function-valued `Ports` shape and hide a mutable cursor behind it

Rejected. The callback record does not return next state. A cursor in `SharedMem`, a process global,
or a mutable closure would make replay depend on ambient call ordering and make concurrent test
processes unsafe. D1 requires state to be owned and threaded visibly by the driver.

### Treat all installed extensions as covered once core is ported

Rejected. Many current hooks perform direct effects outside `ExtCtx.ports`, and the ABI's
function-valued ports do not thread deterministic world state. D5 requires a named conformant
profile and honest exclusions; profile coverage expands only as extensions become effect-free or
world-mediated.

### Build a second simulation-only session loop

Rejected. A parallel loop would make deterministic tests precise about the wrong implementation
and allow production recovery behavior to drift.

### Inject state-machine decisions directly

Rejected. The simulator supplies external outcomes; production code owns decisions. Direct decision
injection bypasses the behavior the tests are intended to validate.

### Keep normalizing time instead of virtualizing it

Rejected for time-dependent behavior. Normalization makes traces comparable but cannot search
timeout, retry, deadline, or backoff trajectories.

### Script `Timeout` as an arbitrary outcome and call that virtual time

Rejected. It usefully tests recovery from a timeout, but it does not prove the clock influences
behavior. Pillar-5 evidence derives completion-versus-timeout from generated latency and the
production request deadline.

### Require a concurrent event scheduler now

Rejected. No ledger-affecting interleaving was found in the current loop, tool dispatch, MCP
subprocess, streaming, or compose-subagent paths. A sequential interaction program is the smallest
faithful model. D9 records the conditions that invalidate this choice.

### Store only seed plus generator version

Rejected. A generator version identifies code but does not preserve a failure if that code becomes
unavailable or its dependencies change. The exact program is the durable replay unit, stored inline
or as a retained artifact.

### Split faults, clock, tracing, and generation into separate ADRs

Rejected initially. These mechanisms share the same environment boundary and reproduction contract.
Splitting them before that boundary is decided risks incompatible abstractions. A separate ADR is
warranted later only for a genuinely independent production contract, such as crash recovery or
durable ledger restoration.

## Consequences

Positive:

- “Motoko DST” gains a mechanical, reviewable architecture rather than a naming aspiration.
- Production and test execution share one effect boundary and one state machine.
- Failures survive generator evolution because the exact program is replayable.
- Logical faults and time exercise real recovery behavior.
- Coverage claims name their extension and adapter/parser profile instead of implying the entire
  installable ecosystem is hermetic.
- The architecture remains proportional to a sequential agent loop; it does not import a
  distributed-systems scheduler without a concurrency contract.

Costs and risks:

- Threading world state touches session recursion, provider dispatch, tool/approval phases, and
  traced entry points.
- Complete returned streaming traces depend on an upstream recorded-stream API that no released
  AILANG through v0.31.0 provides. That prerequisite blocks streaming trace parity; it does **not**
  block the `Ports.model_step` widening, which must precede it (D1).
- The typed tool/deadline boundary replaces the current stringly `Ports.tool_exec` seam.
- Effectful extension coverage may require an extension-ABI major and lockstep package rollout;
  until then those extensions remain outside the baseline profile.
- **Repinning the toolchain forces an extension-ABI major on its own, for a reason unrelated to
  extension coverage.** Measured v0.26.0 → v0.31.0: 381 effect-row edits across 71 files, of which
  three change `packages/motoko-ext-abi/types.ail` — `ExtPorts.ai_step` gains `Trace` (its declared
  row was simply wrong), and all four `ExtensionHooks` rows gain `Rand` and `Trace`. Since that file
  states bumping `ExtensionHooks` is a major version, the repin forces an ABI major **and a
  coordinated re-release of every extension package**. This is a scheduling fact independent of what
  upstream does about the recorded-stream API, and D1 requires the repin, so it is on the critical
  path and must be sequenced rather than discovered mid-migration. Two latent under-declarations
  that v0.26.0 accepted surface as hard errors at the same time: `agents_md.walk_agents` performs
  `FS` undeclared, and `motoko_ext_omnigraph.register_with_config` performs `Process` undeclared.
- **That same ABI major must also carry the extension-model-path widening, and it is the larger
  change of the two.** D1 excludes extension-issued model calls from the interim state-threaded seam
  because `ExtPorts.ai_step` returns `Result[string, string]` and the hook results above it are
  decision-only, so no successor can reach `C2LoopState`. Lifting that exclusion means widening
  `ExtPorts.ai_step`, the hook results that carry its outcome, and the core dispatch results — the
  world-token protocol D5 already requires — alongside the mechanical `Trace`/`Rand` row edits above.
  Until it lands, a profile must **omit** an `ai_step`-calling extension rather than install it —
  excluding its hooks does not work, because six of the eight are dispatched unconditionally and
  reaching an exclusion fails closed (D5). It is a profile-definition rejection if it fails
  to (D1, D5). `compaction_ai` calls it and is in the extension order of **all fourteen** checked-in
  configurations, so each can be made conformant only by disabling the hook that gives it its
  function; the first *useful* interim profile is a purpose-built narrow one rather than a shipped
  configuration.
- The trace contract changes error handling and may expose terminal cases currently visible only in
  logs.
- A typed program schema, request matchers, interaction log, and compatibility policy become
  maintained test infrastructure.
- Generated trajectories enlarge the failure space and make shrinking more valuable.
- The sequential design can become stale if a concurrency feature lands without triggering D9.

## Non-goals

- Physical-fault or distributed-systems simulation.
- A production durable ledger, session resume, or crash-recovery mechanism.
- Declaring every deterministic Motoko test to be DST.
- Removing fixed scenarios or seeded PBT.
- Selecting exact AILANG syntax, module names, serialization library, CI seed counts, or rollout
  commit boundaries; those belong to fresh, source-grounded implementation plans.

## Implementation handoff

The checked spike in `spike/` is complete and negative against pinned AILANG v0.26.0, and its two
load-bearing negative compiler results reproduce on latest-checked AILANG v0.30.0 and v0.31.0.
**Before streaming-trace parity and the DST name** — not before acceptance, which is settled — the
upstream recorded-stream API selected by D1 must land, the toolchain must be repinned to a version
containing it, and the direct positive integration probe must pass. This prerequisite may change the
AILANG dependency and spike artifacts, and it must not silently select the forbidden
delayed-projection fallback.

**Work that does not wait for that gate.** An earlier revision of this section read as though the
whole migration queued behind the upstream API. Three items have no upstream dependency and should
be sequenced first, because two of them change what the migration costs and one is a live defect:

1. **Widen `Ports.model_step`'s result with an emission log** (D1, F2). Behaviour-preserving with
   `emissions: []` at every construction site, testable entirely against `Scripted` providers, and it
   shrinks the eventual adoption to one closure in `live_ports`. **This item does not enable item 2**
   — it widens the result only, and a successor cursor is not an emission.
2. **Fix the scripted cursor, partially** (D1, F6). This requires a **second, bidirectional widening
   of the same field**: `model_step` must take the current provider state and return its successor.
   It is *not* behaviour-preserving — it changes the port's input shape and every construction site's
   contract — and it is grounded in D1's cursor-ownership paragraph, not in the loss-channel rule
   that licenses item 1. Plan and review it as a distinct change even though it touches one field.
   Per D1, the successor's sole persistent copy is **one explicit `C2LoopState` field** until
   `world_state` subsumes it; do not park it in a closure inside the `Ports` value.

   **This item does not fix the extension model path**, and that is a decision, not an oversight:
   `ext_ai_step` reaches the same seam through an ABI that cannot return a successor (D1). It fixes
   the main loop. A profile installing an `ai_step`-calling extension is conformant only by
   excluding **every hook that extension registers** — a coverage cost, and a profile-definition
   rejection if it does not (D1, D5). Note the shape: such an extension is **omitted** from the
   install list, not installed-and-excluded, because six of its eight hooks are dispatched
   unconditionally and reaching an exclusion fails closed. The profile records the omission and its
   reason alongside the per-extension covered/excluded hook ids.
   Budget three things the
   ADR names and the plan must sequence: a
   concrete `ProviderState` declared in `src/core/ports.ail`, the **relocation of `ScriptedStep`** to
   that module or below (the current type is unreachable from both consumers without a module cycle),
   and `ported_provider` returning an initial-state pair. `ScriptedPortsState`/`scripted_model_next`
   (`src/core/test/scripted_ports.ail:20-48`) is a **design precedent, not reusable code** — an
   earlier revision of this item implied it could be wired in, and it cannot.
   `scripts/dst/spike_scripted_cursor_probe.ail` is the executable statement of the defect and
   becomes a passing regression test for the main-loop path when fixed.
3. **Sequence the repin as its own milestone**, budgeting the extension-ABI major it forces
   (Consequences). It is on the critical path because D1 requires it.

**Both gating ADRs are now Accepted — 007 on 2026-07-26, this one on 2026-08-02 — so the plan is
authorised.** It does not wait on the upstream release either, since only the content of one closure
and the parity proof depend on it. See `HANDOFF-implementation-plan.md`. **Cite the spike's measurements rather
than re-estimating them** — M1 (the `Message` migration: 14 minutes, 28 files, 69 additive sites,
and 7 sites needing genuine judgement that a grep-derived estimate misses entirely) and M2 (the
repin) are in `NOTE-spike-findings-real-driver-vertical.md`. The plan must survey every effect call
site and re-verify:

- the direct positive D1 streaming-capture evidence and the recorded-stream API's ABI/runtime
  impact;
- every construction and consumer of `Ports` and `StepProvider`;
- the feasibility and ABI impact of explicitly threading world state through `C2LoopState`,
  provider dispatch, tool phases, approval resumption, and traced results;
- all direct `readLine`, `std/clock`, environment, process, filesystem, network, stream, and random
  effects reachable during a session;
- the typed request/result and timeout contracts for native, delegated, MCP, and extension tools;
- every hook reachable in the proposed baseline profile, whether it uses `ExtCtx.ports`, and every
  direct effect that would exclude it or require an ABI migration;
- every return from the traced session driver;
- the ledger event vocabulary, terminal-summary consumers, and all sites where `ledger_emit` is not
  paired with `ledger_append`;
- current seeded-family and CI behavior; and
- all exhaustive matches affected by world requests, typed termination reasons, programs, and
  outcome types.

The plan must preserve user changes and current behavior while migrating one effect class at a time.
No implementation target should adopt “DST” or “simulation” merely because this ADR exists.

## Latest AILANG upstream recheck

Date: 2026-07-24

The repository-configured MCP endpoint in `.mcp.json` was queried first. Its `ailang_versions` tool
reported v0.30.0 as latest. The MCP snapshot was not sufficient by itself: `stdlib_module` and
`stdlib_search` omitted `stepWithStream` even though the same version's guide still documented it,
the listed streaming design document could not be fetched, and the manual-install asset name
returned 404. Those inconsistencies were treated as MCP indexing/metadata defects, not evidence
that the API had been removed. The v0.30.0 source and example also describe the callback effect row
as “open,” but the exported `! {IO}` signature and the compiler's closed-row rejection of
`SharedMem` make that prose stale or incorrect; the executable contract is load-bearing here.

The MCP-selected version was therefore checked against AILANG's official v0.30.0 tag and released
compiler. The release archive's SHA-256 was verified as
`58561c11ca7be7710b3b4eca9ddfdf263f39bc4e36428969a1968175f10b84b6`; the compiler reports v0.30.0
at commit `e37b370d1d7a9c4e7136b319e38bec4d5f2bd9a0`. The authoritative result is:

- `std/ai.ail:330-337` has the same `stepWithStream` signature as pinned v0.26.0;
- the callback still returns `()` and has the closed `{IO}` effect row;
- the call still returns only `Result[StepResult, AIError]`;
- no recorded-stream API or returned chunk log exists in the v0.30.0 AILANG source;
- both project spike negative probes fail for their intended type/effect reason on v0.30.0; and
- AILANG's v0.30.0 IO-only streaming example checks and runs under `--ai-stub`.

Ruling: no ADR decision changes. The D1 acceptance blocker is current through AILANG v0.30.0.

## Upstream recorded-stream API status

Date: 2026-08-01. Tracking issue:
[`sunholo-data/ailang#546`](https://github.com/sunholo-data/ailang/issues/546) (open, `enhancement`).

Released v0.31.0 (`1f6f7dd28`) still exports no recorded-stream API, so the D1 substrate gate is
**not cleared**. What changed is that the gate stopped being a design question.

Upstream triaged the request on 2026-07-31 and reviewed it the same day. It reproduced the
constraint first-party at HEAD `130ad1da2` — an `{IO}` rendering callback type-checks; an `{FS}`
callback appending each chunk to a file fails with `incompatible closed rows` — and independently
confirmed this ADR's finding. Its verdict was to **adopt this project's reference implementation
rather than reinvent it**: the patch applies clean, is purely additive (+452 lines, 5 files, 0
deletions), its tests pass, and the surrounding suite stays green. The
`{chunks: [StreamChunk], outcome: Result[StepResult, AIError]}` shape was judged correct for the
reason the request gave — a `Result[{result, chunks}, err]` discards every chunk observed before a
mid-stream failure, which is the case replay depends on most. A design doc has landed upstream
(`design_docs/planned/v0_31_0/m-recorded-stream-api.md`) at P0, and authorship is to be credited.

The work is **parked** on one scope question that is explicitly *not* about direction: whether the
fail-loud path's unbounded drain requires adding cancellation to the provider interface. This
project's answer, filed 2026-08-01, is recorded in `REPLY-546-park-unbounded-drain.md`.

**Two facts from that exchange are load-bearing for this ADR:**

1. **None of the parked options changes the `{chunks, outcome}` type.** The shape survived two
   quorum rounds and the park concerns drain semantics beneath it. The API's shape may therefore be
   designed against now, and the adapter seam this ADR requires can be typed before the release
   exists.
2. **No date was promised**, and upstream explicitly advised keeping this project blocked rather than
   waiting. Combined with F2 — that adoption changes nothing observable until `Ports.model_step` is
   widened — the correct response is to proceed with the upstream-independent work rather than to
   idle. D1 and the implementation handoff are revised accordingly.

Ruling: no decision changes; the blocker narrows from "an API must be designed and land" to "a
released binary must ship an API whose shape is already agreed."

## Author self-review record

Reviewer: Codex (`GPT-5`), 2026-07-24. This is an iterative author-side review, not the independent
review required before acceptance.

The review used five adversarial passes:

1. **Current-source feasibility.** Rejected the draft's assumption that the function-valued
   `Ports` record could consume one cross-effect program; replaced it with explicit driver-threaded
   world state and recorded the load-bearing source anchors.
2. **Simulation semantics.** Split reactive seeded discovery from resolved-program replay, added
   ordinal causal request identity, strict versus regression replay, logical resource state, and
   explicit fault state transitions.
3. **Clock and trace attack.** Required timeout to derive from generated completion time plus a real
   production deadline; verified and incorporated AILANG v0.26.0 runtime virtual time; exposed the
   callback/immutable-trace substrate gap; ran the checked capture spike, which proved an upstream
   recorded-stream API is required; and made the returned ledger complete with one final canonical
   `RunSummary`.
4. **Boundary and prior-decision consistency.** Added fail-closed versioned extension profiles,
   separated their semantic definitions from per-run execution manifests, prohibited hidden
   mutable port state, and explicitly amended the phase-core port/raw-effect decisions while
   preserving its functional-core and policy boundaries.
5. **Enforceability and search.** Added capability-plus-routing hermeticity checks, deliberate
   harness-failure probes, generator bounds/version canary, profile evidence, required fault
   reachability, fixed/rotating corpora, and counterexample promotion.

No further decision-level defect was found after those revisions. The ADR intentionally remains
Proposed until the upstream D1 recorded-stream API lands and the direct positive spike passes.
Other residual implementation risks are explicit rather than hidden: AILANG ergonomics may affect
the concrete state-token representation; an effectful-extension profile may require an ABI major;
and the first baseline profile and measured CI seed counts still require operator approval in the
fresh implementation plan. A fresh independent review must attack the revised decisions before
this ADR becomes Accepted.

## Review Comments

_Reviewer: Claude Code (model: `claude-opus-5`), 2026-07-26. Independent review for acceptance._

_Revision used: HEAD `d894638375471ced85c3bc0477975489b08c041b` (branch
`arniwesth/mot-43-l1-seeded-families`). The ADR is grounded at `7b9b4a4c` and HEAD has moved five
commits, but `git diff --stat 7b9b4a4c..HEAD -- src packages scripts Makefile .github` is **empty** —
every commit since is `.agent/`, `design_docs/`, `bun.lock`, `package.json`. Every source anchor in
this ADR is therefore evaluable at HEAD without re-grounding, and 007's HEAD-verified single-actor
and physical-fault rulings carry forward unchanged. Toolchains exercised: pinned AILANG v0.26.0
(`3b52a24`, `~/.local/bin/ailang`) and the local prototype (`~/src/ailang/bin/ailang`, `dev`
`24120ade2-dirty`)._

### R1. D4's virtual clock does not exist on the pinned toolchain, and the Context row that grounds it proves only that a flag is accepted

**Defect:** `--virtual-time` is a status banner. On pinned v0.26.0, `std/clock.now()` returns real
wall-clock epoch and `std/clock.sleep(ms)` blocks for `ms` of *real* time with a run-to-run variable
delta, with or without the flag. Every mechanism in D4 that depends on the runtime clock —
the fixed virtual epoch, the checked-delta mirror, the conformance assertion comparing explicit and
runtime clocks, and the migration safety net that makes residual `std/clock.now` reads deterministic
— is unimplementable as written, on the pinned toolchain *and* on the prototype the D1 probes ran
against.

**Grounding:** Probe (`scratchpad/rowprobe/vclock.ail`): `t0 = now(); sleep(5000); t1 = now();
sleep(1000); t2 = now()`. All five activation paths on pinned v0.26.0:

```text
$ ailang run --virtual-time --caps IO,Clock --entry main vclock.ail
t0=1785077152822 t1=1785077157823 t2=1785077158824 d1=5001 d2=1001
$ ailang run --seed 42 --caps IO,Clock --entry main vclock.ail
t0=1785077158870 t1=1785077163871 t2=1785077164872 d1=5001 d2=1001
$ ailang run --virtual-time --seed 42 --caps IO,Clock --entry main vclock.ail
t0=1785077164923 t1=1785077169927 t2=1785077170928 d1=5004 d2=1001
$ AILANG_SEED=42 ailang run --caps IO,Clock --entry main vclock.ail
t0=1785077170997 t1=1785077176001 t2=1785077177002 d1=5004 d2=1001
$ ailang run --caps IO,Clock --entry main vclock.ail          # no flags, control
t0=1785077177057 t1=1785077182054 t2=1785077183055 d1=4997 d2=1001
```

`t0` is real epoch in every case; `d1` for a 5000 ms sleep ranges 4997–5004 across runs; wall-clock
elapsed is ~6.0 s (`time` reported `real 0m6.102s` under `--virtual-time`, `0m6.033s` without).
Identical on the prototype: `~/src/ailang/bin/ailang run --virtual-time … → t0=1785077068981 …
d1=5001`, `real 0m6.320s`.

Source explanation, offered as diagnosis rather than as the finding: `--virtual-time` and `--seed`
are printed and not otherwise threaded (`~/src/ailang/cmd/ailang/main_run_exec.go:184-189`); the
clock's deterministic branch gates on `ctx.Env.Seed != 0`
(`/tmp/ailang-v030-audit.7DwR3w/internal/effects/clock.go:47,96` — the v0.30.0 release tree), and
`EffEnv.Seed` is populated only from `AILANG_SEED` (`internal/effects/context.go:495-502`), which
also failed to activate it above. I did not diagnose why the env path fails; that is upstream's, not
this ADR's.

The affected ADR text: `ADR:90-91` ("AILANG v0.26.0 does provide runtime virtual time
(`--virtual-time`; `std/clock.sleep` advances it)"); `ADR:124` (the Context row); and D4 at
`ADR:401-411` in full. `ADR:124`'s cited command reproduces *exactly* — `ailang run --virtual-time
--caps IO --no-print scripts/smoke_ports_record.ail` prints `⏰ Virtual time enabled` and exits 0 —
which is the point: the evidence establishes that the flag parses, not that a clock is virtualized.
The stdlib docstring agrees with the ADR and contradicts the implementation
(`~/.local/share/ailang/std/clock.ail:1-5,20-22`: "advances virtual time in deterministic mode").
This is precisely the failure mode the ADR itself named for streaming — "the v0.30.0 source and
example also describe the callback effect row as 'open,' … the executable contract is load-bearing
here" (`ADR:862-864`) — applied to the callback and not to the clock.

Consequences beyond D4. (a) `AdvanceClock(delta)` mapped to `sleep(delta)` makes replay cost real
wall time proportional to modeled latency, which destroys D11's seed budget and, because the delta
is not exact, breaks D7's "monotonic virtual time" as a *deterministic* invariant. (b) The migration
sequencing changes materially: D4 currently leans on runtime virtualization so that un-routed reads
are merely unexplained ("runtime virtualization makes them deterministic but does not record why
they were read", `ADR:407-409`). They are not deterministic. Every residual `now()` —
`src/core/session.ail:788,839,1990,2089` — is a live nondeterminism source until routed, so complete
`std/clock` routing becomes a hard precondition of D5 conformance rather than an incremental
convenience. (c) Acceptance-test row 5 (`ADR:709`) opens with "Discovery/replay run under pinned
runtime virtual time", which no toolchain I tested can satisfy.

**Action:** Delete the runtime-clock mirror from D4 and rely solely on the explicit `world_state`
clock, which D4 already declares authoritative (`ADR:404-406`) and which needs no upstream support.
Concretely: drop the `--virtual-time` requirement, the fixed-epoch/checked-delta/conformance-assertion
paragraph, and the fresh-evaluator-per-seed clause; replace the migration allowance with a hard D5
requirement that no in-profile module may reach `std/clock` directly, enforced by the D5 routing
audit and a `Clock`-capability poison probe. Rewrite acceptance row 5's first clause to test the
explicit clock. Re-ground `ADR:90-91` and `ADR:124` on the executable result above. If the runtime
mirror is retained instead, record it as a **second** upstream blocker of equal standing to the
recorded-stream API and say so in the Status line — but the world-clock-only route is cheaper,
needs no upstream, and is what D1 already requires. The stdlib-docstring/implementation divergence is
independently worth an upstream report, alongside the compile-cache one.

### R2. The ADR amends 004 but leaves in force 004's normative stream-delta ledger-append handle, which this ADR's own spike proves unbuildable

**Defect:** 004 resolved the identical streaming/trace-ordering problem with a *normative* mechanism
— a driver-supplied ledger append handle used *during* the model call — and carried a Phase-B
byte-parity test for it. This ADR's `Amends:` clause preserves 004's "append-only ledger" and
"driver-owned effect execution" and replaces only "function-valued ports as the complete
deterministic-state mechanism" (`ADR:22-26`). It never names 004's append handle, which is not
merely superseded by D1 but *impossible* on any AILANG the spike tested. A future implementer
reading 004 builds the handle; reading this ADR, the emission log. Two live normative answers to one
question, one of which cannot compile.

**Grounding:** `../004_phase_core_refactor/ADR-001-phase-oriented-core.md:152-159`: "**Streaming
protocol** (review P1-R3/P2-R4): … Normative resolution: the driver hands the model phase a **ledger
append handle** (a port) scoped to stream-delta events only; deltas are appended through it in
arrival order while the call is in flight. The handle is driver-constructed, so single logical
authority holds… Phase B carries a byte-parity test for the `thinking_stream_start → N×delta →
thinking_stream_end` sequence." Such a handle must mutate shared state from inside `on_chunk`, whose
row is closed at `{IO}`. The spike settles `SharedMem`; I extended it to `Trace`, which the append
handle would also need:

```text
$ ailang check trace_cb.ail   # top-level func render(chunk) -> () ! {IO, Trace}
Error: … failed to unify parameter 4: failed to unify effect rows:
  incompatible closed rows: r1 has extra labels [], r2 has extra labels [Trace]
```

I also tested the obvious escape hatch — declaring the widened row on an intermediate function's
*parameter* rather than at the `stepWithStream` call site. It fails, and fails at the outer
application, because the inner call narrows the declared parameter row to `{IO}`:

```text
$ ailang check smuggle.ail
Error: … type unification failed at [function application at smuggle.ail:20:11]:
  … incompatible closed rows: r1 has extra labels [], r2 has extra labels [SharedMem]
```

(This also explains why `src/core/test/stub_step.ail:185` can declare `on_chunk: (StreamChunk) -> ()
! {IO, Trace}` and still typecheck — `ailang check src/core/test/stub_step.ail` → `✓ No errors
found!` — while no `{IO, Trace}` function can actually be passed to it. The annotation is inert.)

**Action:** Add 004 §3's stream-delta append-handle resolution to this ADR's explicit amendment list,
stating that D1's returned ordered emission log replaces it and why (the mechanism is unbuildable,
not merely superseded), and say what becomes of 004's Phase-B byte-parity test for the
`thinking_stream_start → N×delta → thinking_stream_end` sequence — the ordering it protects is a live
TUI contract and D1 must preserve it.

### R3. 007 delegates a fifth versioned surface — the ledger event vocabulary and its wire projection — to D5/D8/D11, and none of them carries it

**Defect:** Accepted 007 books the ledger/wire event vocabulary as a maintained compatibility
surface and assigns its "encoding, migration mechanism, and compatibility policy" to this ADR's D5,
D8, and D11. D5's manifest enumerates six recorded fields and the vocabulary is not among them; D8's
compatibility policy is scoped to *program* encoding; D11 is search policy. So an accepted ADR
promises something this ADR does not supply.

**Grounding:** `../007_dst_consolidation/ADR-001-motoko-dst-definition-and-taxonomy.md:311-337` —
"*The ledger event vocabulary and its wire projection.* `LedgerEvent` already carries 34 variants
(`src/core/phase_vocab.ail:597-631`) … the mapping lives in a trailing comment … and the consumer is
a TypeScript `switch` in a separate process (`src/tui/src/index.ts:428`). D2's trace oracle makes
that mapping load-bearing in both directions … Versioning is therefore not one number but four
independent axes … **plus a wire vocabulary shared with the TUI** … The encoding, migration
mechanism, and compatibility policy belong to `../009_motoko_dst_execution/ADR-001-…` (D5, D8,
D11)." Against `ADR:457-461` (the manifest records "source revision, toolchain, extension package
versions, ABI version, profile id/version, and normalized profile configuration") and `ADR:612-614`
(D8's encoding/compatibility policy, scoped to programs).

Verified at HEAD: 34 variants, and all 34 wire names are trailing comments —
`sed -n '598,631p' src/core/phase_vocab.ail | grep -c '^  [=|]'` → `34`, and `| grep -c -- '--'` →
`34`. One variant maps to two wire names (`StreamDelta … -- [prod] thinking_delta |
reasoning_delta`, `phase_vocab.ail:631`). The one recorded guard is already broken: 004's documented
regeneration command, run at HEAD, returns nothing, because `agent_loop_v2.ail` is now a 123-line
compatibility facade —

```text
$ grep -o 'emit_event(session_id, "[a-z_]*"' src/core/agent_loop_v2.ail | wc -l
0
```

— so the "29 event types" inventory pinned in `src/core/phase_vocab.ail:467-470` and
`004/ADR-001:139-147` is both stale against 34 and unregenerable. D6.2 makes this worse before
better: it requires replacing today's `finish_reason_str(r: int)` helper
(`src/core/session.ail:817,835,857`) with a derived typed enumeration, which is exactly the
TUI-observable contract 007 flags.

**Action:** Either add the ledger event vocabulary and the typed termination-reason enumeration as a
fifth recorded axis — versioned in D5's profile/manifest and preserved in D8's failure record — or
state explicitly that this ADR declines 007's delegation and route it back with a named owner. Do
not leave it assigned to three decisions that do not mention it. If adopted, the cheapest form is
the one 007's Open Questions already suggest: derive the wire name from the type so drift is a
compile error, which would also repair the unregenerable inventory.

### R4. D6.4 is unsatisfiable for the one event class this ADR spends most of its effort on, and D1 prescribes the mechanism that violates it

**Defect:** D6.4 requires every logical `LedgerEvent` to be appended to the returned trace *by the
same transition that projects it*. For stream chunks that is structurally impossible, and D1 says so
itself: projection happens inside the callback during the call, the append happens after the call
returns. A reviewer applying D6.4 mechanically must fail the streaming path.

**Grounding:** `ADR:548-551` — "Every logical `LedgerEvent` produced by the driver is appended to the
returned trace by the same transition that projects it to IO/Trace." Against `ADR:156-161` — "A live
adapter also projects each chunk to the UI at arrival; **after the call returns**, the driver appends
the adapter's identical emission log…". The callback cannot do both: its row rejects `Trace` (R2's
first probe) as well as `SharedMem`. `spike/README.md:184-188` records exactly this and rules it "a
note for the implementation plan, not a defect" — but the ADR body, which is the normative document
and the thing the gate is applied to, carries no exception. Acceptance row 7 (`ADR:711`) then asks
for "all logical ledger emissions appear in the returned trace", which parity *can* deliver;
D6.4's stronger same-transition clause cannot.

**Action:** Restate D6.4 as a *parity* obligation — same transition where the mechanism permits,
otherwise an explicitly checked parity invariant — and name stream deltas as the class where
projection and append are necessarily distinct transitions, citing the closed callback row. One
clause; it changes nothing architectural and removes a gate a conformant implementation would fail.

### R5. Acceptance row 4 demands evidence that D3 does not require to exist and D11 does not require to be reported

**Defect:** The fault row of the acceptance test asks for a corpus that reaches "every required fault
class **and its mapped production branch**", but D3 defers the class→branch mapping to the
implementation plan and requires no checkable artifact, and D11's mandated counters report fault
classes only. A reviewer cannot reach yes/no from the gate output; they must judge. That is 007 R8's
defect surviving inside this ADR's fix for it.

**Grounding:** `ADR:708` (row 4) versus `ADR:368-370` — "The **implementation plan** must map every
modeled class to a real production error or result type and name the recovery branch it is intended
to reach" — and `ADR:673-675`, which requires reporting "generator id/version, attempted seeds,
completed `SystemRun` count, harness/generator failures, **fault classes reached**, terminal reasons
reached, and elapsed budget". No branch-level coverage is required anywhere. The mapping table
compounds this by claiming delivery: `ADR:693` reads "4 Logical fault injection | D3 fault catalogue
**mapped to production branches**", which D3 does not do. This now propagates: accepted 007 D2 names
this ADR's D3 as the normative minimum catalogue (`007/ADR-001:190-192`), so the overclaim is
load-bearing outside this project.

**Action:** In D3, require the fault-class→production-branch map to be a machine-readable artifact
that the gate reads (007's Open Question "Fault-catalogue ownership" asks for exactly one source of
truth). In D11, add branch-reached counters alongside fault-class counters. Correct `ADR:693` to say
D3 *requires* the mapping rather than supplies it.

### R6. The promoted regression artifact is the program alone, but the reproducibility promise is conditioned on a manifest the program does not contain

**Defect:** D2 calls the serialized program "the authoritative reproduction artifact" and D11
promotes the program to the fixed corpus, while D8's reproducibility promise holds only "under the
recorded execution manifest/profile" — which is not a field of `ExecutionProgram`. A corpus member
therefore does not carry what its own strict-replay contract requires, and 007 makes the corpus's
oldest member the compatibility floor.

**Grounding:** `ADR:282-289` — `ExecutionProgram` fields are `schema_version, generator_id,
generator_version, seed, initial_world, interactions[]`; `initial_world` carries `extension_profile`
(`ADR:274-279`) but no manifest. `ADR:336-338` — "the serialized resolved program is the
authoritative reproduction artifact". `ADR:620-625` — "Under the recorded execution
manifest/profile, the exact program must reproduce the same normalized interaction log, terminal
outcome, and trace." `ADR:679-680` — "A scheduled failure retains its exact resolved program and is
promoted to the fixed regression corpus." D8's failure *report* does list the manifest
(`ADR:602-603`), but the promoted corpus artifact is specified as the program.

**Action:** Make the manifest travel with the promoted program as one artifact — either a field of
`ExecutionProgram` or a named sidecar the D2 structural validator requires — and state what a corpus
member whose manifest is stale or unresolvable means: strict replay fails closed, regression replay
may proceed with the difference recorded. `NOTE-ailang-world-overlap.md:105-116` already recommends
the stronger form (content-address program, trace, and manifest; retain bytes; fail explicitly on an
unavailable pinned artifact); adopting it here would close this.

### R7. D6.4's logical-versus-display-only classification is required but unlocated, so D7's parity invariant and acceptance row 7 are not decidable

**Defect:** D6.4 requires display-only telemetry to be "classified separately" but names no artifact,
owner, validation, or version for that classification — unlike the profile (D5 gives it a versioned
definition and fail-closed runtime validation) and the program (D2 gives it a structural validator).
D7's "parity between all logical ledger emissions and returned trace records" and acceptance row 7
both quantify over a set nothing defines.

**Grounding:** `ADR:548-551` (the classification requirement, one sentence, no home) and `ADR:552-553`
(only duration and session id are named as display-only). The set is not small at HEAD: `session.ail`
has 37 `ledger_emit` call sites against 14 `ledger_append` sites, and `tool_phase.ail`'s eight
emissions flow through `emit: (LedgerEvent) -> () ! {IO, Trace}` (`tool_phase.ail:311`), a
unit-returning callback that structurally cannot append, into a `ToolDispatchOutcome` that carries no
trace (`tool_phase.ail:148-150`). A concrete instance the Context row does not mention:
`ThinkingStreamEnd` is emitted at `src/core/session.ail:1770` and is absent from the trace expression
built at `:1778`, which appends only `start_event`, `prepared_event`, and `phase.events`.

**Action:** Give the classification the same treatment as the profile — a versioned artifact,
validated at load, fail-closed on an unclassified `LedgerEvent` — and fold it into R3's fifth axis so
one surface carries variant, wire name, and logical/display-only class together.

### R8. Two of D3's four required fault classes are conditional, and nothing requires a run to declare that it waived them

**Defect:** D3's approval row is conditioned on a deadline "enabled by the production policy" and its
extension row on the selected profile containing an effectful hook. Neither condition holds at HEAD
or in the baseline profile D5 sketches, so the normative minimum that accepted 007 defers to can
shrink to provider + tool without any report saying so.

**Grounding:** `ADR:365-366` (both conditions) against `ADR:477-479` — "Current effectful extensions
that bypass `ExtCtx.ports` are excluded until migrated; pure guards and deterministic fixture hooks
may form the initial profile" — and HEAD's approval path, which is a blocking `readLine()` with no
timer (`src/core/session.ail:1616`); `AllowAfterTimeout`/`DenyAfterTimeout`
(`src/core/tool_phase.ail:152-156`) are policy defaults with no deadline behind them. D11 requires
reporting classes *reached* (`ADR:673-675`); nothing requires reporting classes *waived*. Accepted
007 D2 pillar 4 points at D3 as "the normative minimum" (`007/ADR-001:190-192`), so a reader of 007
will over-read what a passing gate proves.

This is honest engineering, not a hole — D4 rightly refuses to invent a retry policy to make the
clock observable (`ADR:430-431`). The defect is silence, not scope.

**Action:** Require the run report and the D5 profile definition to name every required fault class
that the profile waives and the condition that waived it, so a coverage claim is readable against
D3's full table rather than against its applicable subset.

### R9. D3's physical-fault tripwire is weaker than the one accepted 007 D1.3 binds it to

**Defect:** 007 D1.3 names five concrete reopen triggers and says the tripwires "belong both in the
taxonomy ADR and beside the execution runner". This ADR carries the concurrency tripwire precisely
(D9) but reduces the physical-fault tripwire to a general clause naming no trigger.

**Grounding:** `007/ADR-001:175-178` — "**Reopen before adding a crash-recovery, fsync, WAL,
resume-from-ledger, or replicated-state correctness contract.**" Against `ADR:392-393` — "Adding
physical faults or changing the system's durability contract requires revisiting the project scope."
`NOTE-scope-and-sequence.md:92-93` does carry the named triggers, but that NOTE is "Proposed project
boundary", not the normative decision. By contrast D9 (`ADR:648-652`) matches 007 D1.1's four
triggers item for item, which is the standard to meet.

**Action:** Restate D3's physical-fault clause with 007 D1.3's five named triggers, so both
exclusions are equally hard to trip over.

---

## What is accurate

Re-executed or re-read at HEAD `d894638`, not assumed. The three rulings the handoff asked for come
first.

**Ruling 1 — D1's explicitly-threaded world state is threadable through the real driver. Confirmed.**
This is the keystone and it holds. `C2LoopState` is already an explicit record threaded through
`c2_loop`'s recursion and already carries both adapter state and the trace
(`src/core/session.ail:338-357,1509-1524`); adding a `world` field is the same move the record
already makes for `provider: StepProvider` and `trace: LedgerTrace`. Provider dispatch already
returns a successor — `dispatch_step(...) -> { result, next_provider }`
(`src/core/test/stub_step.ail:180-186`) — so `{ result, emissions, next_world }` is an extension of
an existing shape, not a new discipline; the D1 vertical slice models exactly that and compiled
first try. Approval sits directly in the driver branch that already builds the successor state
(`session.ail:1609-1617,1675`). The traced entry point constructs initial state in one place
(`:1989-1995`, `run_v2_session_traced` at `:1999`). There is one driver: `agent_loop_v2.ail` is a
123-line compatibility facade re-exporting `session` (`src/core/session.ail:17`), so no second loop
has to be threaded. The two genuinely hard seams are correctly identified by the ADR and no others
were found: `ToolDispatchOutcome` returns neither state nor trace and must gain both across four
signatures in `tool_phase.ail` and one call site (`session.ail:1658`); and `ExtensionHooks` returns
decisions with broad effect rows and no successor (`packages/motoko-ext-abi/types.ail:151-164`),
which is the ABI major D5 already books. The one seam that cannot be threaded at all is the chunk
callback — which is exactly the upstream ask. D1's "production code does not branch on test mode" is
reachable: the `StepProvider` match in `dispatch_step` is adapter dispatch on a value, which is the
analogy D1 itself draws (`ADR:236-238`).

**Ruling 2 — the single-actor boundary holds, and D9 is correctly scoped.** 007's D1.1 evidence was
verified at `a7932c6`; `src`, `packages`, `scripts`, `Makefile`, and `.github` are byte-identical
between that revision and HEAD, so the ruling carries without re-derivation. Spot-checked anyway:
tool entries recurse in list order (`tool_phase.ail:314-357`), native batches are sequential
(`run_native_batch_rec`, `tool_runtime.ail:151-165`), MCP is a blocking `exec("bash", …)`
(`packages/motoko-ext-mcp/exec.ail:63-70`, reached from `run_mcp_tool` at `:165-170`). D9's four
reopen triggers match 007 D1.1's four item for item, and `NOTE-ailang-world-overlap.md:196-199`
adds the right fourth-party trigger (a World scheduler introducing concurrent ledger-affecting
execution).

**Ruling 3 — the streaming disposition is correct, the gate is genuinely open, and the chunk-timestamp
conclusion survives independent re-derivation.** Re-derived rather than accepted: D2's stream offsets
are *generated* by the seeded generator during discovery and *read from the program* during replay
(`ADR:329-332`), and discovery runs against a deterministic world, not a live provider
(`ADR:261-264`) — so no path in this ADR requires observing a real chunk arrival time. The live
adapter needs arrival *order* only, which the proposed API supplies. D2's "non-decreasing virtual
offsets" clause is therefore reachable, the upstream ask is complete, and it should not acquire a
timestamp requirement. The negative results all reproduce at HEAD (after `rm -rf .ailang` — the
cache caveat is real):
`probe_state_returning_callback_rejected.ail` → `cannot unify type constructor () with *types.TList`;
`probe_sharedmem_callback_rejected.ail` → `incompatible closed rows: … extra labels [SharedMem]`;
`probe_real_stream_callback.ail` under `--caps AI,IO --ai-stub` → `PASS real_stream_callback stop`.
I extended the spike with two escape routes it did not test — a `{IO, Trace}` callback, and the
widened row declared on an intermediate *parameter* — and both fail (see R2), which strengthens the
disposition rather than weakening it. The gate is unambiguously **not** cleared: the prototype is
uncommitted working-tree modifications to `std/ai.ail` and three Go files on `dev`, and the committed
tree has none of it —

```text
$ cd ~/src/ailang && git show 24120ade2:std/ai.ail | grep -c stepWithStreamRecorded
0
$ git show 24120ade2:std/ai.ail | grep -n "^export func stepWithStream"
330:export func stepWithStream(
```

— so the blocker is current on `dev` as well as on v0.26.0 and v0.30.0. `spike/README.md:5-7,43-47`
states this correctly and cannot be read as claiming otherwise. Both new probes pass against the
prototype and are load-bearing: `run_world_slice.sh` → `world_slice: PASS — live and deterministic
paths agree on both outcomes`, including `program_non_empty (emissions=2)`, which is the assertion
that makes a vacuous pass impossible.

**Citation audit — all seventeen Context anchors verified, plus the v0.30.0 line cite.** Every row of
`ADR:109-127` resolves to the claimed construct at HEAD: `ports.ail:17-24` (six function-valued
fields, `tool_exec: (string, string) -> string`); `scripted_ports.ail:20-65` (`ScriptedPortsState`
at 20; `scripted_model_next`/`_approval_next`/`_clock_next` at 38/50/62, each returning `result +
next`); `stub_step.ail:34-41` (exact — the six-field success-only record); `session.ail:146-149`
(exact — `TracedSessionResult { result, trace }`); `:1610-1617` (`readLine()` at 1616);
`:1989-1995` (`now()` at 1990); `:1525-1557` (exact — `InvalidHistory` direct return at 1527-1528,
`emit_run_summary` at 1551 and `DoneEvent` at 1552 both absent from `trace_after_empty_floor`);
`:1609-1614` (pending-approval direct return); `tool_runtime.ail:151-165`; `tool_phase.ail:302-357`;
`packages/motoko-ext-mcp/exec.ail:63-70,165-176` and `:45-70,165-170`;
`stub_step.ail:175-204`; `ai_compat.ail:31-37,60-71,197-220` (`chunks: []` on both arms, docstring
"populating it would require an AILANG Ref"); `motoko-ext-abi/types.ail:62-66,151-164`;
`motoko_scratchpad/scratchpad.ail:90-101` (`on_tool_handle` performs `{Net}` directly, no
`ExtCtx.ports`); `recovery.ail:12-18` (`should_retry_stream_error`, no time dimension). The v0.30.0
cite is exact: `std/ai.ail:330-337` in the release tree is `export func stepWithStream(` through
`_ai_step_with_stream(...)`, with `on_chunk: (StreamChunk) -> () ! {IO}` at 335. The only anchor I
would call imprecise is `scripted_ports.ail:20-65`, which stops one line inside
`scripted_clock_next`; not worth a finding. `ADR:124` is the sole row whose *evidence* reproduces
while its *premise* fails (R1).

**Other claims confirmed by execution or reading.** `Ports.hooks_runtime` has no production consumer
— every occurrence is the declaration and builder (`ports.ail:23,38,46`), a test shape probe
(`stub_step.ail:144,154,167`), or a DST script (`scripts/dst/long_qwen_compaction_dst.ail:186,257`);
its disposition in `ADR:230-232` is a real architectural ruling (it cannot be the world-state
carrier) with only the housekeeping choice deferred, which I read as adequate. D4's HEAD claims hold:
the retry loop is count/budget based (`recovery.ail:17-18`), session `now()` calls derive ids and
durations (`session.ail:788,839,1990,2089`), and MCP/context-mode timeouts are real OS mechanisms
that cannot inherit a virtual clock (`exec.ail:45-61` builds `timeout "${secs}s"` into a bash
script). D6.2's premise is right: `finish_reason_str(r: int)` at `session.ail:817` with
`finish_code: int` at `:835` is the integer-code helper that must be replaced. The
mapping-to-007-pillars table (`ADR:686-696`) holds row by row except row 4 (R5). The rejection of
splitting this ADR (`ADR:775-780`) survives attack: D2/D8 share the program identity, D3/D4 share
deadline derivation, D5/D7 share what invariants may observe, and D1 is upstream of all of them —
the only decision with an independent contract is D11's CI budget policy, which is small enough that
extracting it would cost more than it clarifies.

## Recommended pre-acceptance actions

Ordered by dependency. Items 1–4 are this ADR's to fix before acceptance; 5–7 are body edits that can
land in the same pass; item 8 is not this ADR's to clear.

1. **Resolve R1 first — it changes D4, the acceptance test, and the migration order.** Decide between
   the world-clock-only route (recommended: no upstream dependency, and D1 already declares the
   explicit clock authoritative) and a second upstream blocker. Everything else in D4 and
   acceptance row 5 follows from that choice.
2. **R2 — complete the amendment of 004** before an implementer can act on either document, and
   dispose of 004's Phase-B byte-parity test explicitly.
3. **R3 — settle the wire-vocabulary axis** with accepted 007, since 007 cannot be edited to route it
   elsewhere without reopening an accepted decision. R7's classification folds into whatever surface
   this creates.
4. **R4 — restate D6.4 as parity.** One clause, and it unblocks a gate a correct implementation would
   otherwise fail.
5. **R5, R6, R8, R9** — four bounded edits to D3, D11, D2/D8, and the mapping table.
6. Re-ground `ADR:90-91` and `ADR:124` on executed results, and add the R1 probe to `spike/` so the
   clock claim is defended the same way the streaming claim is.
7. Update the Status line to reflect however many upstream prerequisites survive item 1.
8. **The recorded-stream API remains open and is not mine to clear.** It is unlanded on v0.26.0,
   v0.30.0, and committed `dev` `24120ade2`; the working prototype is uncommitted local changes. D1's
   condition is that the API *land* and the toolchain be *repinned* — a prototype does not satisfy
   it, and `spike/README.md` correctly refuses to claim otherwise.

Belonging to the implementation plan rather than to this ADR: the `ToolDispatchOutcome` and
`tool_phase` emit-callback rework (R7's grounding sizes it), the `motoko-ext-abi` major, the
`ledger_emit`/`ledger_append` pairing audit, and the concrete `DeterministicTestWorld`/`AilangWorld`
naming choice that `NOTE-ailang-world-overlap.md:180-193` defers.

## Accept / revise recommendation

**Revise, then accept.** The architecture is sound and D1 — the keystone — is genuinely threadable
through the real driver; nothing here calls for a redesign. But R1 removes a mechanism D4 is built on
and that the acceptance test requires, R2 leaves a contradictory normative answer live in an ADR this
one claims to amend, and R3 is an unmet obligation to a decision that is already Accepted. Those
three plus R4 should land in the body before acceptance; R5–R9 are bounded edits that can ride along.
The upstream recorded-stream API stays exactly where the ADR puts it — open, external, and blocking
production migration — and R1 should be resolved so it does not silently become a second one.

**Residual risk, recorded as the handoff anticipated.** The migration is under-estimated in a way the
ADR's own warning does not quite cover: R1 means the clock seam must be routed *completely* rather
than incrementally, which moves work from Track 2 into Track 1 and removes the safety net that made a
partial port safe. And the D9 staleness risk is real but well-guarded — the tripwire is stated in
three places and matches 007's wording, so the likelier silent invalidation is not a concurrency
feature but a new `LedgerEvent` variant landing with a wire name in a trailing comment and no
classification, which is precisely what R3 and R7 exist to prevent.

`24120ade2ade3560af35e45fddd496fb1901c836` plus uncommitted changes._

### R1. D4 and its Context anchor rest on a false executable claim: `--virtual-time` does not virtualize `std/clock`

**Defect:** On every activation path tested, `std/clock.now()` returned a real epoch and
`std/clock.sleep()` consumed wall time, so D4's runtime mirror, residual-read safety net,
conformance assertion, and acceptance row 5 cannot be implemented as written.

**Grounding:** I checked a probe whose body is `t0 = now(); sleep(200); t1 = now(); sleep(100);
t2 = now()`:

```text
$ TIMEFORMAT='wall=%R'; time env -u AILANG_SEED ailang run --virtual-time --caps IO,Clock --entry main /tmp/motoko_adr_vclock.ail
t0=1785078295805 t1=1785078296006 t2=1785078296106 d1=201 d2=100
wall=0.406

$ time env -u AILANG_SEED ailang run --seed 42 --caps IO,Clock --entry main /tmp/motoko_adr_vclock.ail
t0=1785078296177 t1=1785078296378 t2=1785078296479 d1=201 d2=101
wall=0.373

$ time env -u AILANG_SEED ailang run --virtual-time --seed 42 --caps IO,Clock --entry main /tmp/motoko_adr_vclock.ail
t0=1785078296534 t1=1785078296735 t2=1785078296835 d1=201 d2=100
wall=0.351

$ time env AILANG_SEED=42 ailang run --caps IO,Clock --entry main /tmp/motoko_adr_vclock.ail
t0=1785078296882 t1=1785078297083 t2=1785078297184 d1=201 d2=101
wall=0.351
```

The local prototype behaves the same:

```text
$ /home/motoko/src/ailang/bin/ailang run --virtual-time --caps IO,Clock --entry main /tmp/motoko_adr_vclock.ail
t0=1785078302670 t1=1785078302871 t2=1785078302971 d1=201 d2=100
wall=0.642
```

The ADR's cited command itself reproduces:

```text
$ ailang run --virtual-time --caps IO --no-print scripts/smoke_ports_record.ail
⏰ Virtual time enabled
[fake] fake drive: t=1234567890 home=(unset)
[fake] emit-only path ok
[fake] scripted: 7, 11, -1
```

That proves only that the flag parses and prints a banner. The prototype source confirms the
disconnect: `/home/motoko/src/ailang/cmd/ailang/main_run_exec.go:184-189` only prints `seed` and
`virtualTime`; the clock implementation selects virtual behavior through `ctx.Env.Seed != 0`
(`/home/motoko/src/ailang/internal/effects/clock.go:46-53,95-104`), and the executed environment
path did not activate it. The load-bearing false claims are `ADR:89-91`, `ADR:124`, D4
`ADR:401-411`, and acceptance row 5 at `ADR:709`.

**Action:** Make the explicit `world_state` clock the only deterministic clock: delete the runtime
mirror, `--virtual-time`, fixed-runtime-epoch, checked-delta, reset, and residual-read-safety
requirements; require every in-profile `std/clock` read to be routed before conformance and enforce
that with the D5 audit plus a no-`Clock` execution capability. Rewrite acceptance row 5 to test the
explicit clock. If the runtime mirror is retained, name a working pinned runtime as a second
upstream blocker and prove it with this behavioral probe rather than the banner.

### R2. D5's capability poison and D6's typed forbidden-effect result have no compatible mechanism on the pinned runtime

**Defect:** A raw ambient-effect bypass denied by AILANG capabilities terminates evaluation instead
of returning a typed value, while D6 and acceptance row 8 require that same forbidden effect to
return `HarnessFailure` with the driver's partial immutable trace.

**Grounding:** D5 requires direct ambient effects to fail the hermeticity probe and combines
capabilities with bypass poison probes (`ADR:474-501`); D6 says a forbidden effect after execution
begins is a typed `HarnessFailure` containing `partial_ledger_trace` (`ADR:528-534,554-556`), and
acceptance row 8 requires deliberate forbidden-effect probes to return that value (`ADR:712`).
The spike already contains a direct capability poison:

```text
$ cd .agent/projects/009_motoko_dst_execution/spike
$ ailang run --caps IO --entry main_scoped stream_capture_probe.ail
Error: execution failed: effect 'SharedMem' requires capability, but none provided
Hint: Run with --caps SharedMem
$ echo $?
1
```

No AILANG `Result`, `HarnessFailure`, or returned partial trace crosses that process failure. An
outer wrapper cannot reconstruct the authoritative immutable trace from `ledger_emit`, because D6
correctly says the returned trace—not external projection—is authoritative (`ADR:548-551`).

**Action:** Separate two cases in D5/D6 and the gate: profile-routing/exclusion violations detected
inside the runner may return typed `HarnessFailure`; a raw capability-bypass poison may be an
expected non-zero evaluator failure but cannot promise a returned partial trace. If both must return
the same typed value, name and substrate-prove an effect-interposition/trapping mechanism that
preserves the driver-owned partial trace before acceptance.

### R3. D2 cannot record one of the external-effect classes D1, D3, and D5 require it to replay

**Defect:** `ExecutionProgram.Interaction` has no extension-effect or process interaction even
though conformant extension-side process effects are part of the authoritative world and required
fault surface.

**Grounding:** D1 includes “conformant extension-side external effects” in the request surface
(`ADR:205-213`); D3 requires the corresponding “provider/tool/process failure” for an effectful hook
(`ADR:366`); and D5 permits effectful hooks only through world-mediated ports (`ADR:463-468`).
But D2's exhaustive conceptual interaction list is only `ExpectProvider`, `ExpectTool`,
`ExpectApproval`, `EnvironmentRead`, `RuntimeRandomDraw`, and `AdvanceClock`
(`ADR:291-298`). The current ABI makes the missing case concrete:
`packages/motoko-ext-abi/types.ail:62-66` contains a distinct
`proc_exec: (string, string) -> string`; it is not a typed tool-call envelope.

**Action:** Add a typed `ExpectProcess`/`ExpectExtensionEffect` interaction with origin, causal
identity, bounded request projection, deadline/timing, typed result, and state transition; or state
normatively that extension `proc_exec` is represented by `ExpectTool` and give the conversion and
identity rules. Ensure D3 process failures and D11 coverage use the same stable class id.

### R4. The amendment of 004 leaves an impossible, contradictory streaming mechanism normative

**Defect:** 004 still requires the live chunk callback to append through a driver-issued ledger
handle while this ADR requires a returned emission log precisely because callback-side append
effects cannot fit the real API.

**Grounding:** `../004_phase_core_refactor/ADR-001-phase-oriented-core.md:152-159` calls the append
handle the “Normative resolution” and requires a Phase-B byte-parity test. This ADR's amendment
metadata (`ADR:22-26`) does not name or supersede that mechanism, while D1 appends only after the
provider call returns (`ADR:154-161`). A direct probe using a
`(StreamChunk) -> () ! {IO, Trace}` callback confirms the handle cannot be passed:

```text
$ ailang check /tmp/motoko_adr_trace_callback.ail
Error: ... failed to unify parameter 4: failed to unify effect rows:
  incompatible closed rows: r1 has extra labels [], r2 has extra labels [Trace]
```

The existing `SharedMem` negative probe independently fails for the same closed-row reason.

**Action:** Add 004's stream-delta append-handle resolution to the explicit amendment list and say
that D1's returned ordered emission log replaces it. Retain and relocate 004's
`thinking_stream_start → N×delta → thinking_stream_end` byte/order parity test to the returned-log
path.

### R5. The wire vocabulary delegated by accepted 007 is absent from D5, D8, and D11

**Defect:** Accepted 007 makes the ledger-to-TUI wire vocabulary a maintained compatibility surface
owned here, but this ADR versions neither its encoding nor its migration/compatibility policy.

**Grounding:** Accepted 007 records the `LedgerEvent`/wire mapping and TUI consumer at
`../007_dst_consolidation/ADR-001-motoko-dst-definition-and-taxonomy.md:310-337`, then assigns its
encoding, migration mechanism, and compatibility policy to this ADR's D5/D8/D11. D5's manifest
fields (`ADR:456-461`) omit it, D8's compatibility policy is for execution programs
(`ADR:612-631`), and D11 contains search policy. At HEAD:

```text
$ sed -n '598,631p' src/core/phase_vocab.ail | rg -c '^  [=|]'
34
$ sed -n '598,631p' src/core/phase_vocab.ail | rg -c -- '--'
34
```

All 34 wire names live in comments, with `StreamDelta` mapping to two names
(`src/core/phase_vocab.ail:597-631`). The separate-process consumer is also not validating the
contract: `src/tui/src/runtime-process.ts:103-112` accepts any string-valued `type` and casts the
object to `AgentEvent`; its union at `:56-101` contains only a subset of ledger variants.

**Action:** Define a versioned event-vocabulary artifact that derives or validates
`LedgerEvent variant ↔ wire name ↔ payload schema ↔ TUI consumer`, record its version in the
profile/manifest and replay artifact, and give it an explicit compatibility/migration rule.

### R6. D6.4 contradicts D1 for stream chunks and would fail a conformant implementation

**Defect:** D6.4 requires projection and trace append to occur in the same transition, but D1
requires live projection during the callback and trace append after the provider call returns.

**Grounding:** Compare `ADR:548-551` with `ADR:154-161`. The direct `{IO, Trace}` callback probe in
R4 fails, so the two operations cannot share a callback transition. The world slice says the same
thing explicitly at `spike/README.md:183-188`: stream projection and append are necessarily
separate and must be checked by parity.

**Action:** Make D6.4 a parity obligation. Require one shared append+project transition where the
substrate permits it, but name stream emissions as the required exception and enforce exact
ordered/no-duplicate parity between the callback projection and returned emission log.

### R7. The fault-to-production-branch gate has no machine-readable map or branch evidence

**Defect:** Acceptance row 4 requires every fault class to reach its mapped production branch, but
D3 delegates the map to prose in an implementation plan and D11 reports only fault-class counters.

**Grounding:** D3 says the implementation plan must map classes and name branches
(`ADR:368-370`); D11 reports “fault classes reached” and terminal reasons, not recovery branches
(`ADR:674-680`); the mapping table nevertheless claims D3 already maps the catalogue
(`ADR:693`); and acceptance row 4 requires the missing evidence (`ADR:708`). The catalogue also uses
open labels such as “protocol-inconsistent typed result” and “corresponding ... process failure,”
so stable sub-class ids are necessary before “every required fault class” is enumerable. Accepted
007 now points to D3 as the normative minimum
(`../007_dst_consolidation/ADR-001-motoko-dst-definition-and-taxonomy.md:189-191`).

**Action:** Require one versioned machine-readable fault catalogue containing stable class id,
applicability condition, production result/error constructor, named recovery-branch id, and
logical-state transition. Make D11 report both class-reached and branch-reached counters from that
artifact, and correct the mapping-table wording from “mapped” to “requires a checked map” until it
exists.

### R8. The promoted reproduction unit omits the manifest under which D8 promises reproduction

**Defect:** D2/D11 call the serialized program the authoritative promoted artifact, while strict
reproduction is conditioned on an execution manifest that is not part of that program.

**Grounding:** `ExecutionProgram` contains schema/generator/seed/initial-world/interactions but no
manifest (`ADR:282-289`); D2 calls that serialized program authoritative (`ADR:336-338`); D8
promises reproduction only under the recorded manifest/profile (`ADR:620-625`); and D11 promotes
the exact program to the fixed corpus (`ADR:679-680`). D8's failure report separately lists the
manifest (`ADR:595-607`), but nothing requires the promoted corpus member to retain or resolve that
sidecar.

**Action:** Define the reproduction artifact as an envelope containing the exact program and
normalized execution manifest, or require a content-addressed manifest sidecar in the program
validator. Specify fail-closed strict replay when the pinned manifest is unavailable and
compatibility-aware regression replay when a newer manifest is deliberately substituted.

### R9. The logical-versus-display-only event set has no owner, version, or fail-closed validator

**Defect:** D6/D7 quantify trace parity over “logical” events but never define the set, so a reviewer
cannot decide whether a missing returned record is a parity defect or permitted telemetry.

**Grounding:** D6.4 introduces the classification without a home (`ADR:548-553`), and D7 requires
parity over that undefined set (`ADR:569-581`). Current source demonstrates why inference is unsafe:

```text
$ rg -c 'ledger_emit\\(' src/core/session.ail
37
$ rg -c 'ledger_append\\(' src/core/session.ail
14
```

For example, `ThinkingStreamEnd` is emitted at `src/core/session.ail:1769-1770` but omitted from the
trace constructed at `:1778`; `ToolDispatchOutcome` carries neither events nor trace
(`src/core/tool_phase.ail:148-150`) while its callbacks emit unit (`:196,219,297,311`).

**Action:** Put logical/display-only classification in R5's versioned event-vocabulary artifact,
fail profile validation on every unclassified variant, and generate the D7 parity set from it.

### R10. Conditional D3 fault classes can disappear from a passing profile without a recorded waiver

**Defect:** Approval timeout and conformant-extension faults are called part of the minimum
catalogue but are conditional, and neither the profile nor D11 must report that they were waived.

**Grounding:** The approval timeout applies only where production policy enables a deadline, and
the extension class only where the selected profile includes an effectful hook (`ADR:365-366`).
HEAD approval blocks on `readLine()` with no deadline (`src/core/session.ail:1609-1617`), while
`AllowAfterTimeout`/`DenyAfterTimeout` are only policy-default variants
(`src/core/tool_phase.ail:152-156`); D5 allows the baseline to exclude current effectful hooks
(`ADR:474-479`). D11 reports reached classes only (`ADR:674-680`).

**Action:** Require each profile and run report to enumerate every D3 class as required,
inapplicable, or waived, with the exact applicability condition and evidence. The fixed-bank gate
must compare coverage against that declared set.

### R11. D3's physical-fault tripwire is weaker than binding 007 D1.3

**Defect:** This ADR replaces 007's named physical-contract reopen triggers with a generic
“physical faults or durability contract” clause, making the runner-side tripwire easier to miss.

**Grounding:** Accepted 007 requires reopening before “crash-recovery, fsync, WAL,
resume-from-ledger, or replicated-state correctness” is added
(`../007_dst_consolidation/ADR-001-motoko-dst-definition-and-taxonomy.md:175-178`); D3 says only
that physical faults or a changed durability contract require revisiting scope (`ADR:392-393`).
The exact list exists in `NOTE-scope-and-sequence.md:92-96`, but that note is informational project
scope rather than this ADR's execution decision.

**Action:** Copy 007 D1.3's five named triggers into D3 and require the same tripwire beside the
execution runner, matching D9's precise concurrency treatment.

## What is accurate

The following rulings were re-executed or re-read at HEAD `d894638`; they are not inherited from
the author review or the earlier independent review.

**D1 threadability — confirmed.** `C2LoopState` is already one explicit value containing provider
state and `LedgerTrace` (`src/core/session.ail:338-357`) and is passed through `c2_loop`
(`:1509-1524`). `dispatch_step` already returns `result + next_provider`
(`src/core/test/stub_step.ail:180-204`). Approval suspension stores the request in the same state
and recurses (`session.ail:1661-1682`), then resumes inside the driver (`:1609-1634`). The traced
entry point constructs and returns that state in one place (`:1989-2015`). The exact sizing commands
returned 13 `next_state: C2LoopState` literals and 16 `c2_loop(` call sites; invasive is accurate,
but no control-flow rewrite is required merely to add and pass a world field.

The hard seams are real and already budgeted: `ToolDispatchOutcome` returns no successor world
(`src/core/tool_phase.ail:148-150,288-364`), and `ExtensionHooks` returns decisions without a world
token (`packages/motoko-ext-abi/types.ail:151-164`), requiring the D5 ABI change. A sum-valued adapter
dispatch can preserve common request/response and transition code just as `StepProvider` does now;
production policy need not branch on a test flag. The local vertical slice passed both outcomes:

```text
$ AILANG_SRC=/home/motoko/src/ailang AILANG_BIN=/home/motoko/src/ailang/bin/ailang ./run_world_slice.sh
mode=success       ... PASS program_non_empty (emissions=2) ... PASS trace_parity
mode=partial_error ... PASS program_non_empty (emissions=2) ... PASS trace_parity
world_slice: PASS — live and deterministic paths agree on both outcomes
```

That slice validates the API/world-request shape, not threading through the real Motoko driver; the
source audit above supplies the latter ruling. `Ports.hooks_runtime` also has a real disposition:
`rg -n 'hooks_runtime' --glob '*.ail' . --hidden -g '!.git/**' -g '!**/.ailang/**'` found only its
declaration/builders, a test-shape probe, and one DST script—no production read. Requiring a
demonstrated purpose or removal while forbidding it as a state carrier is adequate.

**Single-actor boundary — confirmed.** Tool entries recurse in list order
(`src/core/tool_phase.ail:314-357`), native batches recurse synchronously
(`src/core/tool_runtime.ail:151-165`), MCP execution blocks in `exec("bash", ...)`
(`packages/motoko-ext-mcp/exec.ail:63-70,165-176`), and delegated TUI calls are awaited in a
`for` loop (`src/tui/src/runtime-process.ts:618-642`). No ledger-mutating interleaving was found.
D9's four concurrency triggers match accepted 007 D1.1. Search workers with independent worlds do
not violate this boundary. The residual risk is correctly stated: a future parallel tool,
ledger-sharing subagent, background hook, or state-advancing stream handler invalidates the model.

The physical-fault exclusion also matches current source: the exact
`rg -ni --glob '*.ail' --glob '*.ts' '\\b(fsync|write[- ]ahead|wal|resume[-_ ]from[-_ ]ledger|replicated[-_ ]state)\\b' src packages`
command returned no hits, and restart emits `SessionSuspend` then exits without restoring history
(`src/core/session.ail:2209-2216`). R11 is about preserving the accepted tripwire, not current scope.

**Streaming disposition — confirmed.** On a clean copy of the spike:

```text
$ ailang check probe_state_returning_callback_rejected.ail
exit 1: cannot unify type constructor () with *types.TList
$ ailang check probe_sharedmem_callback_rejected.ail
exit 1: incompatible closed rows: ... extra labels [SharedMem]
$ ailang run --caps AI,IO --ai-stub --entry main probe_real_stream_callback.ail
LIVE content {"kind":"Wait"}
LIVE usage
PASS real_stream_callback stop
```

Both prototype probes pass, including partial-stream-then-error and non-empty program parity:

```text
$ AILANG_SRC=/home/motoko/src/ailang AILANG_BIN=/home/motoko/src/ailang/bin/ailang ./run_integration_probe.sh
integration_probe: PASS — all five D1 properties hold on both outcomes
$ AILANG_SRC=/home/motoko/src/ailang AILANG_BIN=/home/motoko/src/ailang/bin/ailang ./run_world_slice.sh
world_slice: PASS — live and deterministic paths agree on both outcomes
```

The prototype is not the gate:

```text
$ git -C /home/motoko/src/ailang rev-parse HEAD
24120ade2ade3560af35e45fddd496fb1901c836
$ git -C /home/motoko/src/ailang status --short
 M internal/builtins/ai.go
 M internal/builtins/ai_step.go
 M internal/effects/ai_step.go
 M std/ai.ail
?? internal/effects/ai_step_with_stream_recorded_test.go
?? probe_recorded_stream.ail
$ committed_count=$(git -C /home/motoko/src/ailang show HEAD:std/ai.ail | rg -c stepWithStreamRecorded || true)
$ printf 'committed_recorded_count=%s\n' "${committed_count:-0}"
committed_recorded_count=0
```

The committed `dev` signature remains the unit-returning closed `{IO}` API at
`std/ai.ail:330-337`; stock v0.26.0 makes both new probe scripts exit 1 with
`IMP010: symbol 'stepWithStreamRecorded' not exported by 'std/ai'`. The API has not landed and no
toolchain has been repinned, exactly as `spike/README.md:43-47` warns.

Chunk timestamps are not a missing upstream requirement. I executed an independent callback probe:

```text
$ ailang check /tmp/motoko_adr_clock_callback.ail
Error: ... incompatible closed rows: r1 has extra labels [], r2 has extra labels [Clock]
```

D2 discovery nevertheless generates the latency/offset as part of the deterministic provider
outcome (`ADR:260-264,325-332`); replay reads it from the program. A live provider is not D2
discovery and needs arrival order, not virtual timestamps. The “non-decreasing virtual offsets”
clause is reachable without observing wall-clock arrival, so the upstream ask is complete.

**Citation audit — all file anchors resolve, with R1 the one false premise.** Every Context-table
source range at `ADR:113-128` was opened at HEAD. The cited constructs are present: six
function-valued `Ports` fields and stringly tool seam; three separate scripted `result + next`
queues; the success-only `ScriptedStep`; `TracedSessionResult {result, trace}`; direct approval and
clock reads; missing returned summaries; serial tool/MCP/provider paths; empty live-wrapper chunks;
real adapter timeout contracts; broad extension effects and direct bypasses; and count/budget
provider retry. The supplied, previously executed v0.30.0 release result is consistent with the
committed `dev` signature I independently inspected. Only the runtime-clock premise fails despite
its cited banner command succeeding.

Other source-grounded D1-D11 claims also hold: the four direct `now()` sites are
`session.ail:788,839,1990,2089`; MCP/context-mode timeouts are real process mechanisms;
`finish_reason_str(int)` is the current terminal helper (`session.ail:817-867`); current
effectful hooks can bypass `ExtCtx.ports`; and no production consumer of `hooks_runtime` exists.

Accepted 007's four independent reproduction axes are all named here: program schema and generator
version in D2/D8, profile version in D5, and execution manifest in D5/D8. R8 is about binding them
into the promoted unit, and R5 is the separate wire-vocabulary obligation. The mapping table's
pillars 1, 3, and the core of 2/5/6/7 have corresponding decisions; pillar 4 overclaims a completed
branch map (R7), pillar 5's runtime mechanism is false (R1), and pillar 6's trace mechanism needs
R5/R6/R9.

**D5 hermeticity is largely buildable, with the R2 distinction required.** Narrow capabilities can
deny `AI`, `Process`, `Net`, `FS`, `SharedMem`, `Clock`, `Env`, and `Rand`; a complete source/ABI
routing audit handles broad `IO`; fail-closed profile validation can reject unclassified
hooks/adapters before dispatch; and runtime routing can return a typed exclusion failure. A raw
capability poison also proves that a bypass cannot silently succeed. What it cannot prove on this
runtime is D6's stronger claim that the capability failure itself returns the driver's typed
partial trace.

**Acceptance-test application at HEAD.** This exact command returned no hits:

```text
$ rg -n 'ExecutionProgram|DiscoveryConfig|HarnessFailure|SimulationProfile|execution_manifest|profile_version|generator_version|DeterministicWorld|LiveWorld|world_state' src packages scripts Makefile .github
```

All eleven rows therefore return **No** at HEAD, not “unknown”:

| Row | HEAD result | Future mechanical status |
|---|---|---|
| Seed generates execution | No | Decidable after D2 implementation |
| Modeled logical environment | No | Decidable after D1/D2, including R3 |
| Honest tested boundary | No | Decidable from the versioned D5 profile |
| Faults reach recovery | No | Not decidable until R7/R10 |
| Virtual time matters | No | Unsatisfiable as written; R1 |
| Production logic under test | No | Decidable by entrypoint/source evidence |
| Complete oracle | No | Not decidable until R5/R6/R9 |
| Harness failures separate | No | Forbidden-effect case needs R2 |
| Discovery/replay stable | No | Decidable after D2/D8 and R8 binding |
| Hermeticity enforced | No | Decidable after D5, with R2's two failure classes |
| Actual search | No | Decidable after D11, but coverage set needs R7/R10 |

Amendment fidelity otherwise holds. This ADR preserves 001's production-code, explicit-fake,
normalized-display-trace, stable-scenario, and invariant decisions while replacing its definition
and incomplete environment/replay architecture as accepted 007 permits. It preserves 004's pure
decision core, production phase transitions, extension-resident policy, and driver ownership; R4
is the unamended streaming exception, while R5 covers the now-load-bearing wire contract. The
rejection of splitting the ADR also survives: D1 is the common boundary; D2/D8 share replay
identity; D3/D4 share deadline semantics; D5/D7 share oracle visibility; and D11 gates the exact
fault/program artifacts those decisions define. D10 and parts of D11 are independently editable
policy, but extracting them would not remove an architectural ambiguity found here.

## Recommended pre-acceptance actions

This ADR must fix, in dependency order:

1. Resolve R1 first: select the explicit-world-only clock or add a second proven upstream blocker;
   then update Context, D4, D5 migration order, acceptance row 5, and Status consistently.
2. Resolve R2's forbidden-effect semantics so the hermeticity and `HarnessFailure` rows demand
   evidence the pinned substrate can return.
3. Complete the 004 amendment and reconcile D1/D6 streaming transitions (R4/R6), retaining the
   live byte/order/no-duplicate parity test.
4. Complete the program's request surface for extension-side process effects (R3).
5. Define and version the ledger/wire/classification surface delegated by 007 (R5/R9).
6. Make the normative fault catalogue and branch/waiver evidence machine-readable (R7/R10).
7. Bind program and manifest into one promoted reproduction artifact (R8).
8. Copy the binding physical-fault tripwires into D3 (R11), then update the status line to list the
   actual remaining blockers.

The fresh implementation plan, not this ADR, owns the concrete `WorldState` representation; edits
to the 13 `C2LoopState` successor literals and tool-phase return shapes; the extension-ABI major;
complete routing of all four current clock reads; centralized terminal finalization; the concrete
event-vocabulary codec and TUI changes; profile source-audit tooling and poison fixtures; branch
instrumentation; CI seed counts/rotation/retention; and either a demonstrated production purpose
for `Ports.hooks_runtime` or its removal. The migration remains feasible but should be estimated as
a cross-cutting redesign of effect routing and trace returns, not as a small diff.

The recorded-stream API remains an external pre-acceptance blocker: the local prototype proves the
proposed shape, but it has not landed on committed `dev`, no release contains it, and Motoko has not
repinned. Clearing that blocker belongs upstream and is not claimed by this review.

## Accept / revise recommendation

**Revise.** D1 is threadable and the streaming/sequential architecture is sound, but R1 makes D4 and one gate row false, R2/R5/R7 leave required evidence non-mechanical, and R3/R4/R6/R8–R11 require bounded architectural corrections; the unlanded recorded-stream API remains a separate external blocker that this review does not clear.

## Review Comments

_Reviewer: Claude (model: `claude-sonnet-5`), 2026-08-01. Third independent review — verification of
the F1–F6 disposition revision, per
`HANDOFF-review-adr-001-f1-f6-revision.md`. This round adjudicates nothing; it verifies the
authoring side's own disposition of F1–F6._

_Revision reviewed: the working-tree ADR at HEAD `99749c7d29d013adac9e252c982d297ace984ba8`
(branch `arniwesth/mot-44-motoko_dst_execution_primer`), i.e. the F1–F6 revision as staged, unmerged.
Toolchain executed: pinned AILANG v0.26.0 (`3b52a24d24431c372ed5605289ef039592209514`, built
2026-08-01). No upstream or forked toolchain was used; every claim below was checked against the
pinned toolchain and HEAD source only. `git diff --stat 7b9b4a4c..HEAD -- src packages scripts
Makefile .github` was re-run rather than inherited (see anchor ruling below)._

### R1. D5's "reachability-aware, not textual" routing-audit requirement is not shown to be buildable, and the repo's own call-graph tool demonstrates the opposite on the exact case that motivated it

**Defect:** ADR:677-684 requires the hermeticity gate's source/ABI routing audit to be
"reachability-aware, not textual," grounded in F2's finding that a textual audit certifies
`dispatch_step`'s dead `stepWithStream` branch as live. The only reachability infrastructure in this
repo — `tools/code-graph` — does not support the granularity this requirement needs, and in its
default configuration cannot even see the file the defect lived in.

**Grounding:**

```text
$ python3 tools/code-graph/query/cgq.py q callers dispatch_step      # default `core` profile
{"data": [], ..., "rows_returned": 0}
```

`dispatch_step` is defined in `src/core/test/stub_step.ail`, and `tools/code-graph/README.md:29-31`
states the default `core` profile excludes `src/core/test/**` — exactly the directory where
`dispatch_step`, `scripted_ports_from_steps`, and `live_ports` live, despite that code being
production-executed (it is not test code by function, only by path). Re-extracting with
`--include-tests` makes the function visible:

```text
$ tools/code-graph/extract.sh --include-tests
$ python3 tools/code-graph/query/cgq.py q callers dispatch_step
{"data": [{"caller": "src/core/session#c2_loop", "distance": 1}, ... 27 rows], "rows_returned": 27}
```

but this only proves the tool can answer *function-level* reachability, and at HEAD `dispatch_step`
now has exactly one match arm (`89a1d67` deleted the other two), so the branch-level question F2
actually turned on — "is this specific ADT arm of a reachable function reachable" — is no longer
even askable against current source, and the tool has no mechanism for it in general: `invokes.csv`
records function calls, not which constructor of a multi-arm `match` a given caller can produce.
Confirming this isn't a fixable configuration slip: the concrete fix applied to this exact instance
(`89a1d67`, "Make the invariant structural instead of conventional") did not add an audit at all — it
retyped `C2LoopState.provider` from `StepProvider` to `Ports` and deleted the dead arms, turning a
runtime/audit-time invariant into a compile-time fact. The ADR's D5 change doesn't mention that this
is the pattern that actually worked here, and doesn't name what would make "reachability-aware"
implementable for the cases where narrowing isn't available (e.g. `ExtPorts`/`ExtensionHooks`, which
stay broad by ABI necessity).

**Action:** Either narrow D5 to what's demonstrated — prefer type-narrowing/structural invariants
over auditing wherever the dead-arm pattern recurs, reserving "reachability-aware audit" for the
genuinely audit-shaped part of the gate (unrouted ambient effects, not ADT dispatch dead code) — or
specify the analysis precisely enough to be buildable (branch/constructor-level, not function-level;
a profile scope that cannot silently exclude load-bearing code under `src/core/test/**`) before this
becomes a name-adoption gate requirement.

### R2. F4's "14, not 4" recount does not hold at HEAD on the pinned toolchain

**Defect:** D4 (ADR:557-563) and the D5 hermeticity bullet (ADR:685-686) both cite a
profile-reachable clock count of 14, broken down as 4 (`session.ail` driver) + 1
(`conversation_loop_v2`, "above the traced entry") + 1 (`ext/runtime.ail` `test_dummy`) + 8
(`motoko-ext-compose` family). Verified at HEAD on pinned v0.26.0: `session.ail` contains exactly
four `now()` call sites total, not five, and none of them is attributable to a fifth,
`conversation_loop_v2`-specific read.

**Grounding:**

```text
$ grep -n "now()" src/core/session.ail
791:  else "session_${show(now())}"
842:  let now_ms = now();
1991:  let started_at_ms = now();
2089:  let started_at_ms = now();
$ grep -n "^import" src/core/session.ail | grep clock
30:import std/clock (now)
```

`now` has exactly one binding (line 30), so no alias hides a fifth call. `conversation_loop_v2` is
defined at `session.ail:2251-2269`; its body calls only `ported_provider` and
`conversation_loop_v2_with_policy` and contains no `now()` call of its own.
`git show 89a1d67 -- src/core/session.ail | grep -- '-.*now\|-.*Clock'` shows no removed
`now()`/`Clock` line, so the missing fifth read is not a casualty of WI-C13c; it traces to the
spike's modified driver (which "carries the throwaway driver surgery," per
`NOTE-spike-findings-real-driver-vertical.md:8-13`), not to mainline `session.ail`. The other two
rows check out exactly: `ext/runtime.ail:190` is the sole hit, and `motoko-ext-compose` totals 8
(`compose.ail` 6 at lines 362,503,597,651,681,767; `author_tools.ail:101`; `authoring/dispatcher.ail:217`).
True total at HEAD: **13, not 14.**

**Action:** Correct the table to 13 (or locate and cite an actual fifth session-adjacent read if one
exists in the profile-reachable set, rather than `conversation_loop_v2`, which has none). The
qualitative conclusion — far above 4, extension-dominated — is unaffected, but this number is now
written into two decisions (D4, D5) in their second revision and should not carry an unverified
figure forward a third time.

### R3. One of the two Context anchor rows marked "re-grounded 2026-08-01" contains an arithmetic error introduced by this revision

**Defect:** ADR:147 grounds the `RunSummary`-bypass premise at "`src/core/session.ail:1554-1555`,
and the **other six** `emit_run_summary` calls at `1325`, `1704`, `1711`, `1762`" — four line
numbers, labeled six. Three hundred lines later in the same revision, D6.1 (ADR:731) correctly states
"five call sites at `1325`, `1554`, `1704`, `1711`, `1762`" — i.e. four others besides 1554, matching
the four numbers actually listed at line 147, not six.

**Grounding:**

```text
$ grep -n "emit_run_summary(" src/core/session.ail
1325:  let _ = emit_run_summary(...)
1554:          let _ = emit_run_summary(...)
1704:              let _ = emit_run_summary(...)
1711:              let _ = emit_run_summary(...)
1762:                    let _ = emit_run_summary(...)
```

Five sites, confirmed independently. Both the count at line 147 ("six") and the count at line 731
("five call sites") were edited in this same revision pass (both are new text per the diff against
the pre-revision ADR); one is right and one is wrong.

**Action:** Change "six" to "four" at ADR:147 (or restate the row as "five call sites total," without
a subtracted count, to remove the off-by-two arithmetic entirely). More significant than the typo
itself: this is the second miscount surviving in this revision's freshly re-verified numbers (with
R2), both introduced during the very re-grounding pass meant to fix stale ones. Treat "re-grounded
2026-08-01" as a claim to re-verify, not a warrant — it does not yet mean what its label implies.

### R4. D1's generalized port-widening rule is stated as fact but demonstrated for only one of the three ports it's applied to

**Defect:** ADR:260-262 asserts the ordering rule — widen the port before adopting whatever fills it
— is general "because every `Ports` field is a lossy crossing of the same kind." The source note this
draws from (`NOTE-spike-findings-real-driver-vertical.md:219-224`) names `approval_read` and
`clock_now` as instances but hedges: "narrow enough that the loss is invisible today." The ADR drops
that hedge and states the rule as established fact. `model_step`'s lossiness is directly demonstrated
— it takes a multi-fire `on_chunk` callback whose values are discarded one layer above `std/ai`
before the call returns (`stub_step.ail:148-155`, cited at ADR:85). `approval_read` and `clock_now`
have no comparable channel:

**Grounding:** `src/core/ports.ail:17-24`:

```ailang
export type Ports = {
  model_step: (string, [Message], (StreamChunk) -> () ! {IO}) -> Result[StepResult, AIError] ! {AI, IO, Trace},
  approval_read: (ApprovalRequest) -> ApprovalResolution ! {IO},
  clock_now: () -> int ! {Clock},
  ...
}
```

`approval_read` is a plain synchronous request/response; `clock_now` is a plain point-read. Neither
has a callback parameter or any other channel through which an intermediate value could be silently
dropped the way `model_step`'s stream chunks are. No loss analogous to F2's has been observed or
argued for either field — the generalization is asserted, not shown.

**Action:** Scope the rule to ports with a callback/emission channel (currently only `model_step`),
or, if the concern is that a future richer `ApprovalResolution`/`clock_now` could lose timing or
channel metadata, say what would need to be true to establish that for those two fields specifically,
rather than inheriting the conclusion from one unrelated instance.

### R5. D1 states `world_state` is the cursor's sole owner as an absolute, but the sequenced near-term F6 fix necessarily places the cursor somewhere else first, and the ADR doesn't reconcile the two

**Defect:** ADR:183-192 states "`world_state` owns every replay and generator cursor, and it is the
only owner," and separately that "the implementation plan therefore retires `C2LoopState.provider`."
Implementation Handoff item 2 (ADR:1109-1112) sequences the F6 fix — wiring `ScriptedPortsState`'s
already-tested threaded cursor into the scripted provider — ahead of, and independent of,
`world_state`, which does not exist yet and is the rest of the D1 migration. Wiring a threaded cursor
before `world_state` exists means it has to live somewhere in the interim — most plausibly an
explicit field alongside `provider: Ports` on `C2LoopState` — which the ADR's own absolute wording
does not sanction. An implementer who takes "the only owner" literally has nowhere ADR-approved to
put the interim state; one who doesn't risks recreating a second home for the same fact, the pattern
F1 was written to rule out, just with a different pair of homes (`Ports`-closure state vs. an
explicit sibling field).

**Grounding:** `C2LoopState.provider: Ports` at `src/core/session.ail:344` (confirmed retyped by
`89a1d67`, not `StepProvider`); `ScriptedPortsState` is defined and unit-tested in
`src/core/test/scripted_ports.ail` but is not a field of `C2LoopState` today, so item 2 as written
requires adding one.

**Action:** Add one sentence to D1 or to Implementation Handoff item 2 naming the interim home for
the cursor (e.g., "a new explicit field on `C2LoopState`, not a second closure-captured cursor, until
`world_state` subsumes it"), so "the only owner" reads as the end-state invariant it's meant to be
rather than a constraint the very next action item can't literally satisfy.

## What is accurate

**F1 (cursor ownership) — resolved for the concrete defect, with the R5 gap.** The prohibition on
deriving replay position from mutable history (ADR:194-203) is stated by name and matches a
confirmed-still-live defect: `scripted_ports_from_steps` (`src/core/test/stub_step.ail:157-168`)
still derives its index from `assistant_count(msgs) - base_assistant_count` over the compacted
payload, unchanged by `89a1d67`. An implementer following the ADR could not repeat F1's specific
`LiveWorld(StepProvider)` mistake, since that arrangement is now named and excluded. The "sole
owner" framing has the R5 gap for the period before `world_state` exists.

**F2 (port-widening ordering) — resolved, and stronger at HEAD than the text argues.** Re-derived
independently: `Ports.model_step` returns `Result[StepResult, AIError] ! {AI, IO, Trace}`
(`stub_step.ail:149`, `dispatch_step` at `192-199`), structurally incapable of carrying an emission
log. `ported_provider` (`session.ail:695-701`) is invoked at all six current entry-point call sites
(`2015, 2051, 2114, 2137, 2267, 2295`) before any loop starts, exactly as claimed. Since `89a1d67`
this is actually stronger than the ADR states: `C2LoopState.provider` is now typed `Ports` directly,
not `StepProvider`, so the funnel is a compile-time guarantee rather than merely a checkable runtime
invariant — the ADR still argues the weaker, pre-`89a1d67` case. The generalization of this to every
`Ports` field is not equally supported (R4).

**F3 (the Clock backstop is a runtime, not build-time, check) — confirmed by direct, independent
reproduction on the pinned toolchain**, not merely re-read:

```text
$ ailang run --caps IO clock_probe.ail        # {Clock,IO} row, branch not taken
taking non-clock branch
completed with result: 0
$ ailang run --caps IO clock_probe2.ail       # same function, branch taken
Error: execution failed: effect 'Clock' requires capability, but none provided
```

This matches the ADR's corrected framing exactly: the row survives declaration but fails only on
actual invocation.

**F4 (profile-reachable clock count) — does not hold as stated; see R2.** The qualitative conclusion
(far above 4, extension-dominated) survives; the specific "14" and the `conversation_loop_v2` row do
not.

**F5 (event-vocabulary artifact is new construction) — resolved, and the added prohibition has real
teeth, contrary to the concern that it might be inert.** `ledger_record_name`
(`phase_vocab.ail:561-579`) names exactly 3 of the 34 `LedgerEvent` variants (counted directly off
the type at `phase_vocab.ail:596-629`) — the 3-of-34 claim is exact. D7's parity invariant ("parity
between all logical ledger emissions and returned trace records," ADR:821) and acceptance row 7
("all logical ledger emissions appear in the returned trace," ADR:973) both use "logical," which is
precisely the undefined classification F5 says doesn't exist yet — so the prohibition on scheduling
those checks before the artifact exists is not decorative.

**F6 (scripted cursor pins under folding compaction) — confirmed still live at HEAD, correctly
sequenced, not yet fixed.** The `assistant_count`-derivation mechanism is unchanged by `89a1d67`;
Implementation Handoff item 2 correctly treats this as open and dependent on item 1, not as already
resolved.

**The narrowed D1 blocking clause is correctly scoped and does not license starting the migration
before this ADR is accepted.** `Ports.model_step`'s structural incapacity to carry an emission log
(verified above under F2) supports treating the widening as behavior-preserving and
upstream-independent, so carving it out of the streaming-parity gate is sound reasoning, not a
loophole. Implementation Handoff's "work that does not wait for that gate" list (items 1–3,
ADR:1102-1114) is followed immediately by the sentence tying "the plan" to "once this ADR and the
project-007 taxonomy ADR are accepted" (ADR:1116), and the Status line still requires this
independent review plus the unlanded upstream release. Read in isolation, the three-item list risks
being mistaken for permission to start now — a presentational risk worth tightening — but the
surrounding text does not actually grant that; it corrects planner sequencing within the still-gated
eventual plan, not the acceptance gate itself.

**The uncorrected Context anchors spot-checked hold.**
`git diff --stat 7b9b4a4c..HEAD -- src packages scripts Makefile .github` was re-run rather than
inherited and returns `Makefile` (2-line, unrelated CLI-alias change), the new
`scripts/dst/spike_scripted_cursor_probe.ail`, `src/core/session.ail`, and
`src/core/test/stub_step.ail` — confirming no other anchored file moved. Three rows grounded in
untouched files were opened directly and match current source exactly: `src/core/ports.ail:17-24`
(function-valued `Ports`, stringly `tool_exec`); `packages/motoko-ext-abi/types.ail:62-66,151-164`
(function-valued `ExtPorts`/`ExtensionHooks` with broad rows); `src/core/tool_runtime.ail:151-165`
(`run_native_batch_rec`, sequential recursion). The inference that unchanged-file anchors are still
good holds on this sample — but R3 shows that of the two rows the revision *did* touch, only one was
correctly fixed, so the inference should not be extended to the touched rows without checking each.

**The two corrected Context anchors are accurate apart from R3's count.** `readLine()` at
`session.ail:1619` and `now()` at `1991` and `2089` (ADR:146) verified present exactly as cited.

**The upstream status section holds and does not overstate.** `REPLY-546-park-unbounded-drain.md:137`
states, in the project's own posted reply, "None of (a), (b) or (c) changes the `{chunks, outcome}`
type" — the ADR's load-bearing claim (ADR:1196) restates the project's own filed position rather than
inferring it. The section correctly states the tracking issue is open and unmerged, and that no
ship date was promised.

**M2's checkable claims hold.** `packages/motoko-ext-abi/types.ail:7` states verbatim "Bumping
`ExtensionHooks` is a major version of motoko-ext-abi," matching the ADR's citation exactly. One of
the two "latent under-declaration" claims is independently reproducible at HEAD without doing the
repin: `agents_md.ail:106`'s `walk_agents` calls `fileExists(...)` (an `FS` effect) while declaring no
effect row at all — a real, currently-uncaught under-declaration. The 381-edits/71-files/3-widenings
figures are correctly framed throughout as a spike measurement rather than a HEAD-verifiable
certainty, consistent with treating M2 as a measurement to cite rather than re-run.

## Recommended pre-acceptance actions

In dependency order:

1. Fix R2 and R3 — both are numeric corrections to tables/rows already written into D4/D5/Context,
   no architectural change required.
2. Resolve R4: scope "every `Ports` field is a lossy crossing" to what's demonstrated (`model_step`),
   or gather equivalent grounding for `approval_read`/`clock_now` before generalizing the rule to
   them.
3. Resolve R1 before D5's reachability-aware audit is treated as a name-adoption gate requirement:
   either specify the analysis precisely enough to be buildable (branch/constructor-level, scoped to
   include `src/core/test/**`), or replace it with the structural (type-narrowing) approach that is
   the one demonstrated fix for the concrete instance that motivated it.
4. Add the one sentence R5 asks for, naming the interim home for the scripted cursor between now and
   full `world_state` migration.
5. Not this ADR's to clear: the upstream recorded-stream API must still land in a released binary
   before acceptance, per the Implementation Handoff's own unmodified opening paragraph and the
   Upstream status section's own ruling.

Items 1–2 belong to this ADR directly. Item 3 is this ADR's requirement but its resolution may
legitimately defer detail to the implementation plan, provided the plan is told which shape of
analysis to build rather than left to infer "reachability-aware" on its own. Item 4 is a one-sentence
ADR fix. Item 5 is external and unowned by any reviewer.

## Accept / revise recommendation

**Revise.** The F1, F2, F3, F5, and F6 dispositions hold up under independent re-derivation — F2's
case is stronger at HEAD than the text argues, since `89a1d67` already made the invariant structural
rather than conventional. F4's recount needs a numeric fix (R2), compounded by an unrelated
arithmetic slip introduced in the same re-grounding pass (R3) — together these mean this revision's
"re-grounded"/"measured" labels should be re-verified rather than trusted at face value even after a
second pass. D5's new reachability-aware-audit requirement (R1) and D1's generalized port-widening
rule (R4) are new normative claims this round introduces without adequate support and should be
narrowed before acceptance. None of R1–R5 reopens D1's core threadability or the streaming
architecture, and none licenses starting the migration early — the ADR's own gating text still
requires this review plus the upstream release before any of that begins. The upstream
recorded-stream API blocker remains open, unmerged, and is not this review's to clear.

## Review Comments

_Reviewer: Codex (model: `GPT-5`), 2026-08-01. Independent verification of the F1–F6 revision._

_Revision reviewed: working-tree ADR blob
`374d46fbe39ccb77b2fd4a5e71b3dabc0c70f741` before this section was appended, at HEAD
`99749c7d29d013adac9e252c982d297ace984ba8` on branch

third-review section when this session began. It was preserved verbatim, so this is necessarily the
fourth `## Review Comments` heading rather than an overwrite of user-owned review history._

### R1. D5's reachability-aware routing audit is not specified as a buildable acceptance gate

**Defect:** Requiring the source/ABI audit to be “reachability-aware, not textual” makes a precise
constructor/branch analysis normative without defining that analysis, its soundness boundary, or a
tool capable of performing it.

**Grounding:** `tools/code-graph/README.md:7-9` calls this repository's call/effect graph a
source-parsed approximation; `:29-33` says the default `core` profile excludes
`src/core/test/**`, although the motivating production seam lives in
`src/core/test/stub_step.ail`. With `--include-tests` already enabled, the executed query was:

```text
$ python3 tools/code-graph/query/cgq.py q callers dispatch_step
... "include_tests": true, "approximate": true ...
... {"caller":"src/core/session#c2_loop","distance":1} ...
... "rows_returned": 27 ...
```

That establishes function-level reachability only. The emitted schema is exactly
`INVOKE_FIELDS = ["from_slug", "to_slug", "resolution", "approximate"]`
(`tools/code-graph/extractor/emit.py:24`), and its parser finds calls with a regex
(`tools/code-graph/extractor/source_parser.py:14,176-199`); it records neither match arm nor
constructor flow. The actual repair for F2 instead made the invariant structural:
`C2LoopState.provider: Ports` (`src/core/session.ail:338-356`) and
`dispatch_step(ports: Ports, ...)` (`src/core/test/stub_step.ail:192-199`) make the deleted
`StepProvider` arms unrepresentable. No reachability audit was built.

**Action:** Make the gate enforceable in one of two ways: prefer structural type narrowing/deletion
where the dead-arm pattern occurs and use a conservative source/ABI inventory for remaining direct
ambient calls, or specify a sound branch/constructor-level analysis, its profile roots (including
production code under `src/core/test/**`), and its fail-closed behavior before naming it as required
acceptance evidence.

### R2. F4's clock disposition reports both the wrong count and spike-only routing as HEAD state

**Defect:** D4 says there are 14 profile-reachable reads and that the four driver reads are routed,
but HEAD has 13 distinct direct `now()` call sites and all four core sites still call ambient
`std/clock.now`.

**Grounding:** Recounted on pinned v0.26.0 with comments excluded:

```text
$ awk '!/^[[:space:]]*--/ && /(^|[^[:alnum:]_])now\(\)/ {n++} END {print n+0}' \
    src/core/session.ail src/core/ext/runtime.ail \
    packages/motoko-ext-compose/compose.ail \
    packages/motoko-ext-compose/author_tools.ail \
    packages/motoko-ext-compose/authoring/dispatcher.ail
13
$ rg 'world_state|WorldState|LiveWorld|DeterministicWorld' src packages scripts --glob '*.ail' | wc -l
0
$ rg '\.clock_now\s*\(' src packages scripts --glob '*.ail' | wc -l
0
```

The 13 sites are four in `src/core/session.ail:791,842,1991,2089`, one at
`src/core/ext/runtime.ail:190`, and eight in `packages/motoko-ext-compose`
(`compose.ail:362,503,597,651,681,767`, `author_tools.ail:101`,
`authoring/dispatcher.ail:217`). `conversation_loop_v2` at
`src/core/session.ail:2251-2269` contains no separate read; `run_v2_with_conversation` calls
`derive_session_id`, which reaches the already-counted site at `:791`. The spike routed the four
driver sites on its throwaway branch, but that surgery is not at HEAD.

**Action:** Change the table to 13 and distinguish source states explicitly: HEAD routes none; the
throwaway spike demonstrated that the four driver sites can be routed; the nine extension-side
sites remain un-routed. Keep the independently confirmed eight-`compose` D5 obligation.

### R3. D1 over-generalizes F2's port-widening rule beyond the only lossy crossing demonstrated

**Defect:** “Every `Ports` field is a lossy crossing of the same kind” is false or undecidable for
the fields to which no richer producer contract or required widened result is named.

**Grounding:** `src/core/ports.ail:17-23` defines six unlike contracts. `model_step` has a multi-fire
chunk callback but returns only `Result[StepResult, AIError]`, so its information loss is concrete.
By contrast, `approval_read` is a synchronous `ApprovalRequest -> ApprovalResolution` and
`clock_now` is `() -> int`; D1 itself preserves those results at ADR:294-295. Neither has an
intermediate channel whose values the port discards, and the revision specifies no widening target
or gate evidence for either. The same blanket sentence also reaches `env_get`, `tool_exec`, and
`hooks_runtime`, even though D1 separately gives only `tool_exec` a named replacement contract and
rejects `hooks_runtime` as a world carrier.

**Action:** Scope “widen before adoption” to `Ports.model_step` and any future port for which a
specific richer producer contract is identified; keep the typed-tool widening as its separately
named decision instead of turning one observed ordering bug into an unenforceable rule over every
field.

### R4. The uncorrected provider-callback Context anchor no longer reaches the implementation it claims to ground

**Defect:** The Context row at ADR:149 still cites `stub_step.ail:175-204` for callback-ordered
provider chunks even though WI-C13c moved both live and scripted provider implementations outside
that range.

**Grounding:** At HEAD, `src/core/test/stub_step.ail:148-154` contains the live closure that passes
`on_chunk` to `stepWithStream`, and `:157-168` contains the scripted closure that calls
`play_chunks` before returning the result. The cited `:175-204` now contains explanatory comments,
the one-arm `dispatch_step` pass-through at `:192-199`, and the start of a constructor helper. At
`7b9b4a4c`, the cited range contained the old `LiveAI`/`Scripted` match arms; `git diff
7b9b4a4c..HEAD -- src/core/test/stub_step.ail` shows those arms were deleted by `89a1d67`.

**Action:** Re-ground that cell on `src/core/test/stub_step.ail:148-168,192-199` (and retain the
upstream API anchor for arrival ordering). The premise remains true; the claimed “remaining anchors
verified unchanged” does not.

### R5. The re-grounded RunSummary Context row miscounts its own citations and omits the direct-return evidence

**Defect:** ADR:147 calls four listed sites “the other six” and does not cite the two terminal
returns that support its claim that other errors return directly.

**Grounding:** The executed inventory is:

```text
$ rg -n 'emit_run_summary\(' src/core/session.ail
833:func emit_run_summary(
1325:  let _ = emit_run_summary(...)
1554:          let _ = emit_run_summary(...)
1704:              let _ = emit_run_summary(...)
1711:              let _ = emit_run_summary(...)
1762:                    let _ = emit_run_summary(...)
```

There are five call sites total, hence four besides `1554`, exactly as D6.1 states at ADR:731-732.
The uncited direct terminal returns are invalid history at `src/core/session.ail:1528-1531` and an
approval-state invariant failure at `:1612-1616`; neither emits a summary.

**Action:** State “five call sites total” and cite the two direct returns separately. Do not derive a
terminal-path count from call-site count; `c2_fail` at `:1301-1327` is one call site shared by
several typed `Fail` reasons.

### R6. The promised Spike-findings disposition section is absent

**Defect:** The revision and its handoff claim a historical `## Spike-findings disposition (F1–F6)`
section exists “below,” but the ADR contains no such section, leaving no author-owned per-finding
disposition record to verify.

**Grounding:** At the pre-review blob:

```text
$ rg '^## Spike-findings disposition \(F1–F6\)$' .agent/projects/009_motoko_dst_execution/ADR-001-deterministic-test-world-architecture.md | wc -l
0
$ rg '^## Review Comments$' .agent/projects/009_motoko_dst_execution/ADR-001-deterministic-test-world-architecture.md | wc -l
3
```

ADR:8 nevertheless says “the F1–F6 round below was dispositioned by the authoring side,” and the
handoff names the missing section as input 2. The normative body contains responses to the findings,
but it is not the historical defendant's summary the review was instructed to preserve.

**Action:** The authoring side should add the promised F1–F6 disposition record without rewriting
the independent reviews, or correct the status/handoff if the intentional record is the body alone.

## What is accurate

**F1 — resolved.** The end-state owner is now decidable: `world_state` is the sole cursor owner,
history-derived position is prohibited by name, and `C2LoopState.provider` is explicitly retired.
Keeping `StepProvider` as an entry argument does not prevent this: `Scripted(script)` can seed the
initial world program/cursor without remaining a cursor owner inside the loop. HEAD is openly
identified as non-conformant (`scripted_ports_from_steps` still derives
`assistant_count(msgs) - base_assistant_count` at `stub_step.ail:157-165`), and Implementation
Handoff item 2 sequences the repair. An implementer cannot reproduce the specific
`LiveWorld(StepProvider)` freeze or retain history-derived replay position while complying with D1.

**F2 — resolved for `model_step`, with R3 limited to the unsupported generalization.**
`Ports.model_step` returns only `Result[StepResult, AIError]` (`ports.ail:17-18`), so it cannot carry
an emission log. `ported_provider` returns `Ports` (`session.ail:695-701`), and its six call sites at
`:2015,2051,2114,2137,2267,2295` normalize every `StepProvider` entry before the loop. Since
`89a1d67`, `C2LoopState.provider` is itself `Ports`, making the funnel structural rather than a
convention. Widening this port before adopting the upstream filler is mandatory and correctly
sequenced.

**F3 — resolved and reproduced.** The existing substrate smoke declares `{Clock, Env, IO}` on both
entries. With only `IO`, the fake branch completes while the taken live clock read fails:

```text
$ ailang run --caps IO --entry main scripts/smoke_ports_record.ail
... [fake] scripted: 7, 11, -1
$ ailang run --caps IO --entry main_live scripts/smoke_ports_record.ail
Error: execution failed: effect 'Clock' requires capability, but none provided
main_rc=0 live_rc=1
```

D4's “stronger and weaker” framing is exact: capability denial catches a read on an executed path
but proves nothing about reachable, untaken paths.

**F4 — not resolved as written.** The qualitative conclusion survives: the set is extension-heavy,
the eight `compose` sites are real, and `ExtPorts.clock_now` has zero reads repo-wide. R2 records the
numeric and source-state corrections.

**F5 — resolved.** The executed counts were `LedgerEvent variants=34` and `named variants=3` from
`phase_vocab.ail:597-631` and `ledger_record_name` at `:561-579`. D7's parity invariant at ADR:821
and acceptance row 7 at ADR:973 both quantify over “logical” events, so forbidding those checks
before the classification artifact exists has real scheduling force.

**F6 — resolved at the ADR level and still open in implementation, as the revision says.** The HEAD
probe was re-run on pinned v0.26.0: the control served `[s0,s1,s2,s3,done]`, the folding case served
`[s0,s1,s2,s2,s2,s2,s2,s2,s2,s2,s2,s2]`, ended in step-budget exhaustion, and exited
`probe_rc=1` by design. D1 excludes the mechanism and the handoff makes the probe a future passing
regression rather than claiming HEAD is fixed.

**The narrowed D1 blocking clause is correct and does not authorize migration before acceptance.**
The port widening is upstream-independent, while only the live closure's recorded content and parity
proof need the released API. ADR:1095-1100 still requires the API to land, the repin, and the positive
probe before acceptance; ADR:1116 says the implementation plan is written only once this ADR is
accepted. “Can be widened today” describes dependency order, not present authorization.

**D6.1's zero-RunSummary claim holds at HEAD.** `emit_run_summary` constructs the only production
`RunSummary` in `session.ail` and performs only `ledger_emit` (`:833-870`). The five callers listed
under R5 never append that value; every `ledger_append` site in `session.ail` appends a decision,
stage, or another named wire event. The two direct terminal returns also append no summary. Thus no
terminal path places `RunSummary` in the returned `LedgerTrace`, even though the projection is
visible. The throwaway spike's finalizer is not at HEAD.

**The upstream return-shape ruling holds and the status section does not claim a merge.** Re-read
from upstream's design object rather than inheriting this project's reply:
`git -C ailang show 386cf6d15:design_docs/planned/v0_31_0/m-recorded-stream-api.md` defines
`RecordedStream = {chunks: [StreamChunk], outcome: Result[StepResult, AIError]}` and presents the
parked choices at lines 38-42: (a) land with the drain caveat, (b) add provider cancellation first,
or (c) bound the drain locally. (a) changes documentation, (b) the Go provider interface, and (c)
the recorded operation's local drain; none changes the public record. Current `upstream/dev`
contains the parked design doc but `git -C ailang grep stepWithStreamRecorded upstream/dev -- std
internal cmd examples` returns no source hit, and no released tag contains the design commit. The ADR
correctly says PARKED/open/unmerged and promises no date.

**M2 is accurately framed as a spike measurement.** Current
`packages/motoko-ext-abi/types.ail:7` says “Bumping `ExtensionHooks` is a major version of
motoko-ext-abi.” `git diff 4aaf59f..6382dc8 -- packages/motoko-ext-abi/types.ail` shows the three
semantic widenings: `ExtPorts.ai_step` gains `Trace`, and all four hook rows gain `Rand` and
`Trace`. Consequences labels 381 edits/71 files as “Measured v0.26.0 → v0.31.0”; it does not present
that edit count as a fresh HEAD recount.

**The unchanged-file Context-anchor inference holds; the blanket uncorrected-anchor claim does
not.** `git diff --name-only 7b9b4a4c..HEAD` over every anchored source file returns only
`src/core/session.ail` and `src/core/test/stub_step.ail`. Spot checks in untouched files still match:
`ports.ail:17-23` is function-valued/stringly, `motoko-ext-abi/types.ail:62-66,151-164` has the
claimed function-valued ABI/broad rows, and `tool_runtime.ail:151-165` is sequential recursion.
Within the changed files, `ScriptedStep` (`stub_step.ail:34-41`) and `TracedSessionResult`
(`session.ail:146-149`) still match, but R4 and R5 mean the revising session's inference does not
cover every uncorrected/touched row.

## Recommended pre-acceptance actions

**This ADR must fix, in dependency order:**

1. Resolve R1 before D5's hermeticity audit becomes name-adoption evidence: specify a buildable
   analysis or use conservative inventory plus structural invariants.
2. Correct F4 per R2, including both 13-versus-14 and HEAD-versus-spike routing state.
3. Scope D1's port-widening rule to demonstrated contracts (R3).
4. Repair the two Context anchors (R4/R5) and restore or explicitly dispose of the missing
   author-owned F1–F6 disposition record (R6).
5. After those edits, obtain a fresh independent verification; do not treat either appended review
   as clearing revisions it has not seen.

**The implementation plan, after acceptance, owns:** widening `Ports.model_step` first; moving the
scripted cursor into the sole world state and turning the F6 probe green; constructing the event
vocabulary before classification-dependent D7/acceptance checks; routing every in-profile clock
site, including the eight `compose` reads, through the world; and sequencing the measured
toolchain/extension-ABI major rollout. It must not substitute the throwaway spike for any gate.

**External and not this ADR's author or reviewer's to clear:** the recorded-stream API must land in
a released AILANG binary, Motoko must repin to that release, and the direct positive integration
probe must pass before acceptance, exactly as D1 and the handoff require.

## Accept / revise recommendation

**Revise.** F1, F2, F3, F5, F6, D6.1, the narrowed blocker, the upstream return shape, and M2 survive
independent execution/source checks; F4 does not, D5 still names an unspecified static analysis as a
gate, and the anchor/disposition record is incomplete. The upstream API remains parked, unmerged,
unreleased, and is not cleared by this review.

## Review Comments

_Reviewer: Kimi (model: `moonshotai/kimi-k3` via OpenRouter), 2026-08-01. Third independent
verification of the F1–F6 revision, per `HANDOFF-review-adr-001-f1-f6-revision.md`._

_Revision reviewed: the working-tree ADR at HEAD `99749c7d29d013adac9e252c982d297ace984ba8` (branch
`arniwesth/mot-44-motoko_dst_execution_primer`) — i.e. the F1–F6 revision body, which is itself
**uncommitted** (`git diff HEAD --numstat` on this file: 814 insertions, 27 deletions, of which the
last ~597 lines are the two prior 2026-08-01 verification sections). Toolchain executed: pinned
AILANG v0.26.0 (`3b52a24d24431c372ed5605289ef039592209514`, `~/.local/bin/ailang`). Every claim below
was re-run or re-read by me before I compared notes with the two uncommitted 2026-08-01
verifications already in this file; the convergence recorded at the end is therefore independent,
not inherited. This is the fifth `## Review Comments` heading, not the third the handoff's output
contract anticipated — see R8. Nothing above this section was edited._

### R1. F4's clock disposition is wrong three ways at HEAD: the count is 13 not 14, the `conversation_loop_v2` row misattributes the fifth read, and "Only the first row is routed" imports spike-branch state as HEAD state

**Defect:** D4 (ADR:557-568) claims a measured 14 profile-reachable clock reads with a separate
`conversation_loop_v2` row, and asserts "Only the first row is routed" (ADR:566). At HEAD on pinned
v0.26.0 there are 13 distinct `now()` call sites in the named set; `conversation_loop_v2` performs
no read of its own; and **no** row is routed — the routing existed only on the throwaway spike
branch.

**Grounding:** Recounted by me, comments/imports excluded:

```text
$ grep -n 'now()' src/core/session.ail …        → 791, 842, 1991, 2089        (4, driver)
$ grep -n 'now()' src/core/ext/runtime.ail      → 190                         (1, test_dummy)
$ grep -n 'now()' packages/motoko-ext-compose/  → compose.ail: 362,503,597,651,681,767 (6)
                                                  author_tools.ail: 101 (1); authoring/dispatcher.ail: 217 (1)
```

Total: 4+1+8 = **13 distinct sites**. `now` has a single binding in `session.ail`
(`import std/clock (now)`, line 30), so no alias hides a fifth driver read. `conversation_loop_v2`
(`session.ail:2251-2269`) calls only `ported_provider` and `conversation_loop_v2_with_policy` — no
`now()` in its body, and it takes `session_id` as a parameter. The read the spike's own table
attributed to `session.ail:2374 (run_v2_with_conversation)` resolves at HEAD to
`run_v2_with_conversation` calling `derive_session_id()` at `session.ail:2293`, whose fallback
branch is the already-counted site `:791` (`else "session_${show(now())}"`) — a real reachability
path "above the traced entry" but the *same call site*, so the table double-counts it. At HEAD,
`session.ail:2374` is inside `test_millicents_to_usd_fraction`. The spike measured on its own
surgically-modified driver (`NOTE-spike-findings-real-driver-vertical.md:8-13`: "carries the
throwaway driver surgery"), which explains both the line drift and the fifth row. For the
routed-state clause: all four driver sites at HEAD call ambient `std/clock.now` directly
(`derive_session_id` at 791, `emit_run_summary` at 842, `1991`, `2089`); no world clock exists at
HEAD (`rg 'world_state|WorldState|LiveWorld|DeterministicWorld' src packages scripts --glob '*.ail'
→ 0` hits), so "Only the first row is routed" is false at HEAD — it restates the spike table's
"routed through the world" State cell, which described the throwaway branch. Corollary: ADR:568's
"nine of the fourteen" should be "nine of the thirteen". The D5 bullet's "eight clock reads"
(ADR:686) is exact and survives.

**Action:** Correct the table to 13 distinct sites; replace the `conversation_loop_v2` row with the
accurate statement (the M8 entry `run_v2_with_conversation` reaches the already-counted
`derive_session_id` fallback at `:791` above the traced entry); and state the routing status as it
is at HEAD — none routed at HEAD, four demonstrated routable on the throwaway spike, nine
extension-side reads still unrouted. Do not carry a third revision forward with "measured" numbers
that were measured on a different tree.

### R2. D5's "reachability-aware, not textual" audit requirement names a property, not a buildable analysis — and the one fix that actually landed was structural, which the ADR does not say

**Defect:** ADR:677-684 makes a reachability-aware source/ABI routing audit a hermeticity-gate
requirement, motivated by F2's dead-ADT-arm false positive. Nothing in this repo can answer the
branch-level question that motivation turns on, and the ADR neither specifies the analysis nor
mentions that the concrete instance was fixed by type narrowing, not by any audit.

**Grounding:** Executed against the repo's only call-graph infrastructure:

```text
$ python3 tools/code-graph/query/cgq.py q callers dispatch_step
{"data": [{"caller": "src/core/session#c2_loop", "distance": 1}, …], …}
$ sed -n '24p' tools/code-graph/extractor/emit.py
INVOKE_FIELDS = ["from_slug", "to_slug", "resolution", "approximate"]
$ sed -n '14,18p' tools/code-graph/extractor/source_parser.py
DECL_RE / CALL_RE = regex-based extraction
```

Edges are function-to-function only; `ctors.csv` (101 rows) indexes constructor *declarations*
(`slug,module,name,type_slug,source`), not constructor flow, so "can any reachable caller produce
the variant this match arm consumes" is unanswerable from the emitted tables. `tools/code-graph/README.md:7-9`
calls the call graph a "source-parsed approximation" and `:29-31` states the default `core` profile
excludes `src/core/test/**` — the directory containing `dispatch_step`, `scripted_ports_from_steps`,
and `live_ports`, which are production-executed despite the path (the current `.out` happens to be
an `--include-tests` build; the default still excludes them). Meanwhile `89a1d67` repaired the
motivating instance structurally: `C2LoopState.provider: Ports` (`session.ail:344`) and
`dispatch_step(ports: Ports, …)` (`stub_step.ail:192-199`) make the dead arms unrepresentable — a
compile-time invariant, strictly stronger than any audit this gate could plausibly run. The ADR's
F2 grounding paragraph even narrates this deletion but draws no lesson from it.

**Action:** Narrow D5 to what is demonstrably buildable, in order of preference: (1) require the
structural pattern first — dead-arm seams of this class must be made unrepresentable by type
narrowing, as `89a1d67` did, with the audit as backstop rather than primary; (2) for the residual
ambient-effect inventory, name the actual analysis (a function-level, conservatively
over-approximate call graph with a profile scope that explicitly includes production code under
`src/core/test/**`, plus fail-closed manual triage of its false positives — noting that for a
*hermeticity* audit over-approximation fails closed, which the F2 case did not); or (3) if
constructor-level reachability is genuinely required, specify it (analysis, soundness boundary,
profile roots, fail-closed behavior) before it becomes name-adoption gate evidence. As written the
gate demands a detector no one has built or specified.

### R3. The revision header's "the rest verified unchanged" is falsified by one uncorrected Context row in the touched files: `stub_step.ail:175-204` no longer grounds "provider chunks are callback-ordered"

**Defect:** The header (ADR:14-16) claims the five Context rows anchoring into the two files changed
by `89a1d67` were re-checked, two corrected, and "the rest verified unchanged". Context row ADR:149
cites `src/core/test/stub_step.ail:175-204` for callback-ordered provider chunks; at HEAD that range
contains only comment text and the one-arm `dispatch_step` pass-through — the constructs that ground
the premise moved.

**Grounding:**

```text
$ grep -n 'func play_chunks\|stepWithStream(model\|export func dispatch_step' src/core/test/stub_step.ail
88:func play_chunks(chunks, on_chunk: (StreamChunk) -> () ! {IO, Trace}) …
152:      stepWithStream(model, msgs, tools_with_extensions(rt), system_prompt_cache_breakpoint(), on_chunk)
192:export func dispatch_step(
```

The live streaming call is at `:152`, the scripted chunk playback at `:88-99`, the scripted closure
at `:157-165` — all outside the cited `:175-204`. Worse, the cited range's own comment block is now
internally contradictory: `:171-173` still says dispatch "Returns both the step result and the
updated provider (tail of script for Scripted)" and that "Loop callers thread next_provider", while
`:191` in the same block says "There is no `next_provider` to return" — the stale half describes the
pre-`89a1d67` signature the commit deleted. The premise remains true (both closures fire `on_chunk`
serially), but the row as cited grounds it in a comment that also asserts a false return shape, and
the header's blanket claim does not survive contact with this row. `git diff --stat 7b9b4a4c..HEAD
-- src packages scripts Makefile .github` re-run by me returns exactly `Makefile` (2-line CLI-alias
change), the new `scripts/dst/spike_scripted_cursor_probe.ail`, `src/core/session.ail`, and
`src/core/test/stub_step.ail` — so no *other* anchored file moved, and the two prior reviews'
certification covers rows in untouched files; the gap is confined to this one row inside the changed
set.

**Action:** Re-ground the row on `src/core/test/stub_step.ail:88-99,148-165,192-199`; correct the
header claim (or re-verify the remaining touched-file rows individually and say which); and delete
the stale `next_provider` comment half in `stub_step.ail` as part of the same fix (source edit,
noted here because the ADR anchors into it).

### R4. The re-grounded RunSummary Context row labels four line numbers "the other six"

**Defect:** ADR:147 reads "`src/core/session.ail:1554-1555`, and the **other six** `emit_run_summary`
calls at `1325`, `1704`, `1711`, `1762`" — four numbers, labeled six; D6.1 (ADR:731-732) correctly
says five call sites in the same revision.

**Grounding:**

```text
$ grep -n 'emit_run_summary(' src/core/session.ail
833 (defn); call sites: 1325, 1554, 1704, 1711, 1762 — five total, four besides 1554
```

Both counts were introduced in this same re-grounding pass; one is right (D6.1) and one is wrong
(Context). Two further nits in the same row: "other errors return directly" is grounded by the
InvalidHistory return at `session.ail:1528-1530` and the approval-invariant return at `:1612-1615`,
neither of which the row cites; and the note's original "seven terminal returns" was never a
call-site count — `git grep -c emit_run_summary 4aaf59f -- src/core/session.ail` shows the same five
call sites pre-`89a1d67` — so the correction to citing sites is right, and the original number is a
live example of why spike numbers must be re-run, exactly as the handoff warned.

**Action:** Restate as "five call sites total" (or "the other four"), and cite the two direct
terminal returns for the second clause.

### R5. D1's "every `Ports` field is a lossy crossing of the same kind" is demonstrated for exactly one field

**Defect:** ADR:260-262 states the general rule — widen the port before adopting whatever fills it
— as established fact "because every `Ports` field is a lossy crossing of the same kind". The
source note hedges (`approval_read`/`clock_now` are "narrow enough that the loss is invisible
today"); the ADR drops the hedge. Only `model_step` has a demonstrated loss channel.

**Grounding:** `src/core/ports.ail:17-24`: `model_step` takes a multi-fire
`(StreamChunk) -> () ! {IO}` callback whose values the returning closure discards
(`stub_step.ail:148-155`) — the F2 loss, directly demonstrated. `approval_read:
(ApprovalRequest) -> ApprovalResolution ! {IO}` is a synchronous request/response with no
intermediate channel; `clock_now: () -> int ! {Clock}` is a point read; neither has anything
analogous to a dropped emission log. The ADR's own D1 bullets preserve those two result types
unchanged (ADR:294-295: "approval remains a typed `ApprovalResolution`", "clock reads return the
current world time"), so the rule as stated would mandate widenings the same decision neither names
nor justifies.

**Action:** Scope the rule to ports with a demonstrated loss channel (today: `model_step`; the
stringly `tool_exec` has its own separately-named typed-envelope widening), or state what evidence
would establish lossiness for `approval_read`/`clock_now` specifically. Keep "widen before adopting"
for `model_step` — that case is proven and the sequencing is correct.

### R6. "The only owner" is stated as an absolute, but the ADR's own handoff item 2 must house the scripted cursor somewhere else first

**Defect:** ADR:183-191 makes `world_state` the sole cursor owner and retires
`C2LoopState.provider`, while Implementation Handoff item 2 (ADR:1109-1112) sequences the F6 fix —
a threaded scripted cursor — ahead of, and independent of, `world_state`, which does not exist yet.
The interim home for that cursor is unnamed, so the next implementation action cannot literally
comply with the absolute wording.

**Grounding:** `C2LoopState.provider: Ports` at `session.ail:344` (immutable record value);
`ScriptedPortsState` (`src/core/test/scripted_ports.ail:20-65`) is unit-tested
(`test_scripted_model_threads_state`) but consumed nowhere — `run_v2_with_scripted_ports`
(`scripted_ports.ail:99`) still routes through `scripted_ports_from_steps`. Item 2's own mechanism
("once `model_step` returns a record it can return next-state too") implies the driver must store
that successor somewhere — a new explicit field on `C2LoopState` or a replaced provider value —
which is a second, non-`world_state` home for the cursor by construction.

**Action:** Add one sentence to D1 or to handoff item 2 naming the interim home (e.g. an explicit
`C2LoopState` field until `world_state` subsumes it), so "the only owner" reads as the end-state
invariant it is meant to be.

### R7. The `## Spike-findings disposition (F1–F6)` section the revision and handoff both reference does not exist

**Defect:** ADR:8 says "the F1–F6 round below was dispositioned by the authoring side", and the
handoff names the disposition section as review input 2 and as a historical record not to be
edited; no such section exists in the committed blob or the working tree.

**Grounding:**

```text
$ grep -c '^## Spike-findings disposition' ADR-001-….md   → 0 (working tree)
$ git show HEAD:…ADR-001….md | grep -c 'Spike-findings disposition' → 0 (committed blob)
$ grep -c '^## Review Comments' ADR-001-….md              → 5 (working tree, incl. this section)
```

The normative body does carry per-finding responses, but the author-owned defendant's summary the
review process was built around is absent.

**Action:** The authoring side adds the disposition record (without touching any review section),
or corrects ADR:8 and the handoff to name the body as the record.

### R8. The entire F1–F6 acceptance record is uncommitted, and this handoff has already been executed twice — the output contract's "append a third section" would falsify the record if followed literally

**Defect:** The F1–F6 revision body, the claude-sonnet-5 verification, and the GPT-5 verification
are all uncommitted working-tree content on top of HEAD `99749c7d`; the committed ADR contains none
of it. The handoff describes "two existing review sections" and instructs appending "a third" — two
executions of that same handoff later, this is the fifth `## Review Comments` heading and the third
independent verification of the revision.

**Grounding:**

```

Consequences, not complaint: (a) anyone reading the committed ADR sees none of the revision this
round verifies; (b) the Status line's "a fresh independent review of this revision is also required"
is currently satisfiable only by uncommitted text; (c) my findings below converge with the two prior
verifications because the defects are real and were re-derived independently — but the record
should show that there *are* three verifications, not one.

**Action:** Commit the revision together with all three verification sections (or deliberately
restart the round); do not squash, reorder, or "correct" the prior sections — they are historical
records. Any body edit made in response to R1–R7 post-dates all three verifications and needs a
fresh delta review, not a fourth full round.

## What is accurate

Re-run or re-read by me at HEAD `99749c7d` + working-tree revision, on pinned v0.26.0. The three
requested rulings first.

**Ruling 1 — per-finding dispositions.** **F1: resolved.** `world_state` as sole cursor owner plus
the by-name prohibition on history-derived position (ADR:183-203) excludes the failing arrangement
by mechanism, not merely by naming it: an adapter holding the cursor violates "sole owner"
regardless of how explicitly it threads state. HEAD is openly named non-conformant ("the arrangement
that currently executes … a confirmed defect in the harness today (F6)"), the transition is
sequenced (handoff items 1-2), and "the implementation plan therefore retires
`C2LoopState.provider`" (ADR:191) is a ruling, not a deferral. `Scripted(script)` remaining the
entry-point argument (`scripts/dst/phase_c2_wiring_scenarios.ail:120,126,184`) does not undermine
this — `ported_provider` (`session.ail:695-701`) already normalizes it before loop state exists.
Caveat: R6's interim-home gap. **F2: resolved for `model_step`.** `Ports.model_step` returns
`Result[StepResult, AIError] ! {AI, IO, Trace}` (`ports.ail:17-18`) and structurally cannot carry an
emission log; `ported_provider` is invoked at all six entry-point sites
(`session.ail:2015,2051,2114,2137,2267,2295`) before any loop starts; since `89a1d67` the funnel is
a compile-time fact (`C2LoopState.provider: Ports`), stronger than the ADR's checkable-invariant
argument. The generalization beyond `model_step` is R5. **F3: resolved, exactly.** Re-ran both
probes on pinned v0.26.0 — synthetic: a `{Clock, IO}` function taking the non-clock branch
completes under `--caps IO` (rc=0), the clock branch dies `effect 'Clock' requires capability`
(rc=1); real driver: `scripts/smoke_ports_record.ail` `main` rc=0 vs `main_live` rc=1 with the same
error. "Stronger and weaker" is the correct framing and D4 does not under-claim.
**F4: not resolved as written — R1.** The qualitative conclusion (extension-dominated, 8-of-13 in
`compose`, default-profile reachable via `handle_compose_tool`) survives; the number, the
attribution, and the routed-state clause do not. `ExtPorts.clock_now` has zero invocation sites
repo-wide (`.clock_now(` → no matches; constructions only), so the D5 conformance condition is
load-bearing and correct. **F5: resolved, with real teeth.** Counted directly:
`ledger_record_name` (`phase_vocab.ail:561-579`) names 3 of the 34 `LedgerEvent` variants
(`:596-630`, all 34 wire names in trailing comments, `StreamDelta` mapping to two) and collapses 31
to `"wire"`. D7's parity invariant (ADR:821) and acceptance row 7 (ADR:973) both quantify over
"logical" emissions — the undefined classification — so the prohibition on scheduling those checks
before the artifact exists is not inert. **F6: resolved at the ADR level, live in code as stated.**
Re-ran `scripts/dst/spike_scripted_cursor_probe.ail` at HEAD on pinned v0.26.0: control
`served=[s0,s1,s2,s3,done]` advancing=true; folding `served=[s0,s1,s2,s2,s2,s2,s2,s2,s2,s2,s2,s2]`,
`assistants_out` pinned at 2 while `segment_in` grows to 23, death by step-budget exhaustion, rc=1
by design. The ADR correctly treats it as open and sequenced, not fixed.

**Ruling 2 — the narrowed blocking clause is correct and opens no hole.** The port widening is
upstream-independent (a record-field addition testable against `Scripted` providers), and what
remains gated is exactly the live closure's recorded content plus the parity proof. The narrowing
does not license pre-acceptance migration: the Status block (ADR:5-8) still names the upstream
release and an independent review as the acceptance blockers, and the handoff binds the
implementation plan to "once this ADR and the project-007 taxonomy ADR are accepted" (ADR:1116).
"Can be widened today" describes dependency order inside that plan, not present authorization. The
one presentational risk — the three-item "work that does not wait" list readable in isolation as
permission — is covered by the immediately following gating sentence; acceptable as written.

**Ruling 3 — the uncorrected Context anchors hold in untouched files; the header's blanket claim
does not hold inside the two changed files.** Re-ran the diff myself (four files: `Makefile`,
probe, `session.ail`, `stub_step.ail`). Spot-checked ten rows in untouched files, all exact:
`ports.ail:17-24` (six function-valued fields, stringly `tool_exec`); `scripted_ports.ail:20-65`;
`tool_runtime.ail:151-165`; `tool_phase.ail:302-357`; `motoko-ext-mcp/exec.ail:63-70,165-176`;
`ai_compat.ail:31-37,60-71,197-220` (`chunks: []` on both arms); `motoko-ext-abi/types.ail:62-66,151-164`;
`motoko_scratchpad/scratchpad.ail:90-101` (direct `{Net}`); `recovery.ail:12-18` (count/budget
retry); `phase_vocab.ail:557,561,596-630`. Inside the changed files: `ScriptedStep`
(`stub_step.ail:34-41`) and `TracedSessionResult` (`session.ail:146-149`) still exact; the two
corrected rows are right apart from R4's arithmetic (`readLine()` at `session.ail:1619`; `now()` at
`1991`,`2089`; the five `emit_run_summary` sites); and R3's row is stale. The inference the handoff
asked about — prior certification covers unchanged-file anchors — holds on this sample and is worth
stating as a ruling; it must not be extended to rows inside the two changed files.

**D6.1's zero-`RunSummary` claim holds at HEAD, verified path by path.** `emit_run_summary`
(`session.ail:833-870`) contains exactly one ledger operation, `ledger_emit(session_id,
RunSummary({…}))` at `:857`; `RunSummary` appears nowhere else in `session.ail` but its import, so
no `ledger_append` ever receives one. Five call sites (R4); `1325` is `c2_fail`, the shared
error-return helper reached through the `Fail` decision's several finish codes; the Finalize branch
(`:1554-1559`) emits `RunSummary`/`DoneEvent` and returns `trace_after_empty_floor` containing
neither; the two direct returns (InvalidHistory `:1528-1530`, approval-invariant `:1612-1615`)
return with no summary at all; `1704`/`1711`/`1762` append their error events, never the summary.
The spike's `c2_finalize` fix is not at HEAD, and the ADR correctly instructs treating D6.1 as
unimplemented everywhere.

**The upstream status section is accurate and does not overstate.** Re-derived from the upstream
design doc itself (`git -C ailang show
386cf6d15:design_docs/planned/v0_31_0/m-recorded-stream-api.md`): status PARKED,
`needs-human-review`; the offered shape `RecordedStream = {chunks: [StreamChunk], outcome:
Result[StepResult, AIError]}`; options (a) land-with-caveat (documentation), (b) provider-interface
cancellation (Go `AIHandler`, 7 implementers), (c) bound the drain locally (chunk/byte budget) —
none touches the AILANG-level `{chunks, outcome}` record, which is what licenses designing against
the shape now. The ADR's "survived two quorum rounds" matches the doc's "Quorum BLOCKED twice … the
design DIRECTION … survived both rounds"; "recommended adoption, parked on scope" matches the
ADOPT-direction/PARKED-on-scope split. The API is absent upstream: `git -C ailang grep
stepWithStreamRecorded upstream/dev -- std internal cmd examples` → no hits, and no recent tag
contains it. "Not merged, no date promised" is stated plainly; the fork prototype is not treated as
the gate anywhere in the ADR.

**M2 is real and correctly framed.** `packages/motoko-ext-abi/types.ail:7` states verbatim "Bumping
`ExtensionHooks` is a major version of motoko-ext-abi". The three widenings verified on the spike
branch: `git diff 4aaf59f..6382dc8 -- packages/motoko-ext-abi/types.ail` shows `ExtPorts.ai_step`
gaining `Trace` and all four `ExtensionHooks` rows gaining `Rand` and `Trace` — at HEAD the hook
rows are still `{IO, Process, FS, AI, Env, Net, SharedMem, Clock, Stream}` with neither. The
Consequences text cites "381 effect-row edits across 71 files" as "Measured v0.26.0 → v0.31.0" —
measurement framing, not a forecast.

## Recommended pre-acceptance actions

This ADR must fix, in dependency order:

1. **R1** — correct the F4 disposition (13, the attribution, the routed-state clause). It is written
   into D4 and cited by D5, so it lands first.
2. **R3 + R4** — repair the two Context rows and the header's "the rest verified unchanged" claim;
   same re-grounding pass, same files.
3. **R2** — narrow or specify the reachability-aware audit before it becomes gate evidence; prefer
   the structural pattern `89a1d67` demonstrated.
4. **R5** — scope the port-widening rule to demonstrated loss channels.
5. **R6** — one sentence naming the interim cursor home.
6. **R7** — restore the disposition record or correct the references to it.
7. **R8** — commit the revision and all three verification sections as one record; any body edit
   from items 1-6 post-dates all three verifications and requires a fresh delta review, which the
   Status line should say.

Belonging to the implementation plan, not this ADR: the `Ports.model_step` widening; the scripted
cursor fix that turns `spike_scripted_cursor_probe.ail` into a passing regression test; the
event-vocabulary construction ahead of any classification-dependent D7/acceptance check; routing
all 13 profile-reachable clock reads including the eight `compose` sites through the world/
`ExtPorts.clock_now`; and sequencing the measured extension-ABI major. The throwaway spike branch
must not be cited as gate evidence for any of it.

External and not this review's to clear: the recorded-stream API must land in a released AILANG
binary, the toolchain must be repinned to it, and the direct positive integration probe must pass
before acceptance. It is parked upstream, unmerged, unreleased, and unchanged by anything in this
round.

## Accept / revise recommendation

**Revise.** The architecture and the F1/F2/F3/F5/F6 dispositions survive a third independent
execution-grounded verification — the third verifier to reach that conclusion, independently — but
the F4 disposition carries false numbers and false state into two decisions (R1), D5 names an
unspecified analysis as a gate (R2), the re-grounding pass falsified its own completeness claim
(R3/R4), and the acceptance record exists only in an uncommitted working tree (R7/R8). This is the
same core defect set found by both prior 2026-08-01 verifications; three independent convergences
on identical findings is the strongest evidence they are real. The upstream recorded-stream blocker
remains exactly where the ADR puts it — open, parked, external — and is not cleared by this review.

## Review Comments

_Reviewer: Claude Code (model: `claude-opus-5`), 2026-08-01. **Delta review** of the F1–F6
correction pass, per `HANDOFF-delta-review-adr-001-f1-f6-corrections.md`. Sixth section: two reviews
2026-07-26, three verifications 2026-08-01, this delta._

Reviewed at `5eadee76dc66d687d697e277784e82a991d79bfb` (working tree clean), corrections committed as
`d3bd9cd` plus the two ADR edits in `5eadee7`. Toolchain `AILANG v0.26.0` (commit `3b52a24`),
matching `scripts/install-prerequisites.sh:39`. Scope is the corrected text only; F1, F2, F3, F5, F6,
D6.1, the narrowed D1 blocking clause, the upstream return-shape ruling, M2, and the architecture are
not reopened.

The pre-correction blob is confirmed unretrievable, so no correction could be isolated by diff:

$ git cat-file -e 374d46fbe39ccb77b2fd4a5e71b3dabc0c70f741 || echo "NOT IN OBJECT STORE"
NOT IN OBJECT STORE
```

Every claim below was re-executed at HEAD. Nothing is inherited from the handoff's enumeration, from
the spike branch, or from the three prior verifications.

### R1. D5 obligation 2 does fail open, but not for the reason the OPEN DEFECT gives — the real hole is profile scope, and run as written the inventory misses 8 of the 13 clock reads D4 depends on

**Defect:** The marked OPEN DEFECT (ADR:791-805) attributes obligation 2's fail-open to
`_resolve_call` discarding `ports.model_step(...)`. That mechanism does not establish fail-open, and
resting the repair on it will produce the wrong fix. The tool captures direct ambient calls in both
syntactic forms; what it drops is calls *through* the seam, which are already routed. The actual
fail-open is that obligation 2 names only one scope correction (`src/core/test/**`) while the
default profile is `("src/core",)` and excludes `packages/` — where D4 itself puts 8 of the 13
reads.

**Grounding.** The tool resolves bare selective imports (`source_parser.py:193-198`) and qualified
std calls (`:186-187`, which returns without any membership check — a permissive, genuinely
over-approximate path). Executed against the real extractor:

```text
$ python3 -c "...sp.parse_all([session.ail, compose.ail, stub_step.ail])..."
src/core/session      std_calls now: derive_session_id, emit_run_summary,
                                     run_v2_from_messages_traced_with_policy_and_counts,
                                     run_v2_from_messages_with_policy_and_counts   (4)
compose               std_calls now: snippet_meta_json, one_attempt, one_attempt,
                                     run_attempts, handle_compose_tool, on_response_intercept
stub_step             model_step edges: []
```

The four `session.ail` rows are exactly D4's four attributed driver functions — i.e. the inventory
obligation 2 is *for* works. The empty `model_step` edge list is the drop the OPEN DEFECT cites, and
it is a routed call, not an ambient one. Any direct ambient effect is written literally at some
definition site inside the scanned tree, and the tool sees the literal form there; the seam-drop
hides the *edge*, not the *call*, and a module-level inventory does not need edges.

The scope hole, executed across all three profiles (`tools/code-graph/extractor/config.py:13-17`,
`source_parser.py:37-39,53-56`):

```text
profile=core include_tests=False: files=34  clock_std_calls=5
profile=core include_tests=True:  files=43  clock_std_calls=5
profile=all  include_tests=False: files=178 clock_std_calls=14
```

Obligation 2 as written — `core`, plus `src/core/test/**` — yields **5**. It misses all 8
`motoko-ext-compose` reads, which D5's own third bullet (ADR:749-751) makes a conformance
precondition. `include_tests=True` changes nothing, because the `core` profile's root tuple never
contained `packages/`. That is a 62% miss on the one measurement D4 and D5 jointly depend on.

A second, independent defect in the same tool: its output is neither a site count nor a stable
function count. The plain-call path dedups on `(from_slug, std_module, symbol)`
(`source_parser.py:257-262`), so N ambient calls in one function collapse to one row; the
interpolation path (`:267-281`) carries no `seen` check, so interpolated calls emit unconditionally.
`compose#one_attempt` appears twice because `:503` is interpolated and `:597` is plain, while a
function with two plain calls would appear once. The audit therefore cannot reproduce D4's "13
distinct call sites" and cannot certify routing *completeness* — only that a function mentions an
ambient symbol.

**Ruling on the handoff's A1 question.** The correction has the tool preference inverted, and a
conservative textual inventory is the right primary detector for *this* use. D4's 13 was reproduced
here by exactly that method:

```text
$ grep -rn "\bnow\s*(" --include=*.ail src packages
```

which returned all 13 in-profile sites plus `scripts/smoke_ports_record.ail:65` — over-approximate
and complete, which is the required bias. D5's disparagement of "grep-based audit" is correct only
for F2's architecture-discovery use, which obligation 2 already separates by name; it should not
carry over to hermeticity inventory.

**On effect rows as primary detector:** not viable alone at HEAD. `src/core/agents_md.ail:106`
declares `func walk_agents(current: string, acc: [string]) -> [string]` with no effect row while
calling `fileExists(...)` at `:109` — a live `FS` under-declaration. Rows are the right *eventual*
primary, because they are compiler-checked and cannot silently rot, but only behind a
declared-versus-performed reconciliation gate that does not exist.

**Action:** Replace obligation 2's tool with a conservative textual inventory of ambient-effect
imports and call names, per in-profile module, at **site** granularity, with fail-closed manual
triage; state its profile roots as `src` + `packages` explicitly, and state its soundness boundary
(it cannot see effects performed outside the scanned AILANG tree — e.g. TypeScript child processes —
and cannot see which sites are reachable). Delete the over-approximation argument that rests on the
call-graph. Name effect-row reconciliation as the successor detector and its blocker. Constructing
the inventory belongs to the implementation plan; naming the detector and its boundary belongs to
this ADR, because D5 is what the name-adoption gate cites.

### R2. The OPEN DEFECT's non-citability is marked only in D5, while D4 restates the same unsupported bias and requires the same audit for the clock gate, unmarked

**Defect:** D5's marker ends "**D5's routing audit must not be cited as name-adoption gate evidence
until it does**" (ADR:805). But D4:601-604 independently asserts the property the marker retracts,
and D4 is the section a profile reads for the clock:

> the **source and ABI routing audit** enumerates such reads — conservatively and with
> over-approximate bias, per D5 — and is the one a profile depends on

That is C10's softened text, and it now propagates a claim D5 has withdrawn, with no marker. D5's
own third hermeticity bullet (ADR:749-751) makes the same audit a conformance precondition —
"cannot claim conformance until its eight clock reads route through `ExtPorts.clock_now` (D4)" — and
is likewise unmarked. A reader entering at D4 or at the hermeticity bullet list gets the retracted
claim with no signal.

**Grounding:** `ADR:601-604`, `ADR:749-751`, `ADR:805`.

**Action:** Either propagate the non-citability marker to D4:601-604 and D5's third bullet, or —
better — repair obligation 2 per R1 and delete all three markers together. Do not leave the
retraction reachable from only one of the three places that assert it.

### R3. C8 names the interim cursor's home but no mechanism reaches it, and the only mechanism available under the widening Handoff item 1 specifies violates C8's own prohibition

**Defect:** C8 (ADR:235-244) puts the interim scripted cursor in "**one explicit field on
`C2LoopState`, threaded by the driver** — not in a closure captured inside a `Ports` value". C13
(ADR:1223-1228) supplies the mechanism: "It rides on item 1: once `model_step` returns a record it
can return next-state too." But item 1 (ADR:1220-1222) specifies the widening as
"Behaviour-preserving with `emissions: []` at every construction site" — an emissions field and
nothing else — and C9 (ADR:305-319) scopes the port-widening rule to `model_step`'s *demonstrated
emission* loss channel specifically. A successor cursor is not an emission. Item 1 as specified does
not enable item 2.

Working the mechanism through to HEAD source, the two candidate completions both fail:

- If the successor returned is a `Ports`, the driver stores it in `C2LoopState.provider`
  (`src/core/session.ail:344`, already `provider: Ports`) and the cursor lives inside that value's
  closure — precisely "a closure captured inside a `Ports` value", which C8 prohibits by name.
- If the successor is a bare cursor, the scripted closure must receive it back on the next call. It
  cannot: `Ports.model_step` is `(string, [Message], (StreamChunk) -> () ! {IO}) -> ...`
  (`src/core/ports.ail:18`) with no state parameter. The pre-built state machine C13 points at is
  shaped `scripted_model_next(state) -> {result, next}` (`src/core/test/scripted_ports.ail:38-48`)
  — state in *and* out — which is not `model_step`'s shape at either end.

So the F6 fix requires `model_step` to gain a state **parameter** as well as a successor field. That
is a bidirectional widening, it is not behaviour-preserving, and it is named nowhere: not in C9's
loss-channel scoping, not in item 1, not in the D1 bullet at ADR:349-353.

**Grounding:** `ADR:235-244`, `ADR:305-319`, `ADR:1220-1228`; `src/core/ports.ail:18`;
`src/core/session.ail:338-357`; `src/core/test/scripted_ports.ail:38-48`.

**Action:** State the interim mechanism in D1 or item 1 explicitly — that `model_step` takes and
returns provider state alongside `emissions`, that this is a second widening of the same field on a
second stated ground, and that it is *not* behaviour-preserving. Then reconcile C9: either widen its
scope sentence to cover state-threading as a named ground distinct from emission loss, or say that
`model_step` is widened twice for two reasons. As written the three paragraphs are jointly
unsatisfiable.

### R4. C6's claim that `stub_step.ail:175-204` "now contains only comment text" is false — that range holds `dispatch_step`'s entire definition

**Defect:** The re-grounded Context row (ADR:181) states the previously cited `:175-204` "predates
`89a1d67` and now contains only comment text, part of which is itself stale." Only `175-191` is
comment. Lines `192-199` are the complete definition of `dispatch_step` — including `:198`, the sole
`ports.model_step` call — and `203-204` open `prose_step`.

**Grounding:**

```text
$ awk 'NR>=190 && NR<=204 {printf "%d: %s\n", NR, $0}' src/core/test/stub_step.ail
190: -- There is no `next_provider` to return: a Ports is immutable, and the old
191: -- Ported branch returned it unchanged.
192: export func dispatch_step(
193:   ports: Ports,
...
198:   ports.model_step(model, msgs, on_chunk)
199: }
203: export pure func prose_step(text: string) -> ScriptedStep {
```

The old anchor was not invalidated by comment drift; it still lands on live code. That matters
because the row's stated reason for re-grounding is wrong, and the ADR's own lesson —
"a 're-grounded' label is a claim to re-verify, not a warrant" (ADR:40) — is what this violates.

**Action:** Correct the parenthetical to "the previously cited `:175-204` predates `89a1d67`; the
comment half (`175-191`) is partly stale (see below) and the code half is now the one-arm
`dispatch_step` at `192-199`, cited separately above."

### R5. C7's two anchors are each off by one, and one of them names a line that is not stale

**Defect:** The *Known stale source comment* note (ADR:185-193) cites `stub_step.ail:170-171` as the
stale text and `:189-190` as the self-contradiction. Both are shifted by one.

**Grounding:**

```text
170: -- Dispatch one step call through the provider.                      <- accurate, not stale
171: -- Returns both the step result and the updated provider (tail of script for Scripted).
172: -- Loop callers thread next_provider into their recursive call.
...
189: --                                                                    <- bare comment marker
190: -- There is no `next_provider` to return: a Ports is immutable, and the old
191: -- Ported branch returned it unchanged.
```

The two stale sentences the note quotes are at `171-172`; the note's range includes `:170`, which is
correct and must survive the source fix, and omits `:172`, which must not. The contradicting sentence
is at `190-191`. An implementer executing the deferred source fix against the cited ranges would
delete a good line and leave a stale one.

**Action:** Change `170-171` to `171-172` and `189-190` to `190-191`.

**On deferring the fix itself:** deferring is right. Moving source under an in-review ADR is the
pattern that produced these stale anchors, and the note is explicit about why. But the deferral is
only safe if the ranges are exact, which is what R5 fixes. Record the source fix as a work item
somewhere durable — right now it exists only inside a prose note in a proposed ADR.

### R6. `HANDOFF-review-adr-001-f1-f6-revision.md:216` still claims D6.1 was confirmed three times — the exact overstatement `5eadee7` narrowed in the ADR

**Defect:** The Status line was correctly narrowed to "D6.1's zero-`RunSummary` claim by two of the
three" (ADR:14-15). C14's handoff edits did not carry that narrowing across:

```text
$ sed -n '215,217p' .agent/projects/009_motoko_dst_execution/HANDOFF-review-adr-001-f1-f6-revision.md
... F1, F2, F3, F5, F6,
D6.1, the narrowed blocking clause, the upstream return-shape ruling, and M2 were each independently
confirmed three times and are not reopened.
```

That paragraph is in the *corrected* part of the handoff — the closed output contract C14 added, not
the preserved historical contract — so it is a live instruction, and it tells the next reader D6.1 is
settled more firmly than it is.

**The narrowing itself is correct.** Codex verifies D6.1 path-by-path at ADR:2825-2829; Kimi at
ADR:3201-3209. Claude's section touches D6.1 only at ADR:2398, and there only to cite its *count* in
support of a different finding — not a ruling on the zero-`RunSummary` claim. "Two of the three" is
the accurate reading.

**Action:** Narrow HANDOFF:216 to match ADR:14-15.

### R7. C6's `88-99` range for `play_chunks` overshoots into the next function

**Defect:** The Context row (ADR:181) cites `src/core/test/stub_step.ail:88-99` for `play_chunks`.
`play_chunks` is `88-96`; `97` is blank and `98-99` open `assistant_count`.

**Grounding:**

```text
 96: }
 97:
 98: pure func assistant_count(msgs: [Message]) -> int {
 99:   match msgs {
```

Harmless to a reader, but this row was re-grounded in the pass whose stated purpose was anchor
precision, and `assistant_count` is the function F6 is *about* — an anchor that silently spans both
is the kind of thing that reads as intentional later.

**Action:** Change `88-99` to `88-96`.

## What is accurate

**C11's count and routing state are right this time — ruled explicitly.** Re-derived from scratch at
HEAD on pinned v0.26.0, not inherited:

```text
$ grep -rn "\bnow\s*(" --include=*.ail src packages
src/core/session.ail:791, 842, 1991, 2089                                   (4)
src/core/ext/runtime.ail:190                                                (1)
packages/motoko-ext-compose/compose.ail:362,503,597,651,681,767             (6)
packages/motoko-ext-compose/author_tools.ail:101                            (1)
packages/motoko-ext-compose/authoring/dispatcher.ail:217                    (1)
                                                                        total 13
```

Thirteen, with the table's per-file split (4 / 1 / 8) exact and the compose sub-split (`compose` 6,
`author_tools` 1, `authoring/dispatcher` 1) exact. The wider sweep the handoff asked for finds
nothing further: `import std/clock` appears in exactly six files repo-wide, no import is aliased
(`grep -rn "std/clock (.*as"` → empty), so no alias hides a site; `src/core/session.ail:30` is the
single `now` binding in the driver, confirming "no fifth"; and there are **zero** `sleep(` call sites
in `src`, `packages`, or `scripts`. The only clock read outside the tabulated set is
`scripts/smoke_ports_record.ail:65`, a standalone smoke module with its own `main`, correctly out of
the session profile.

Attributions verified: `:791` is inside `derive_session_id` (`session.ail:788-792`), which is called
at `1990`, `2088`, and `2293`; `2293`'s enclosing function is `run_v2_with_conversation`
(`:2277`), exactly as the correction says. `conversation_loop_v2` (`:2251-2269`) takes `session_id`
as a parameter and performs no clock read — the phantom row is correctly retired. `:842` is inside
`emit_run_summary`; `1991` and `2089` are `started_at_ms` in the two `run_v2_from_messages_*`
entry points.

"Nothing is routed at HEAD" holds, and is in fact stronger than stated: `clock_now` has **zero
invocations repo-wide** for *both* `Ports` and `ExtPorts`. Every hit is a field construction or a
`noop_clock_now` definition; `src/core/session.ail:675` passes `p.clock_now` through to `ExtPorts`
without calling it.

The default-profile reachability argument for the eight compose reads also holds:
`handle_compose_tool` is reached from `on_tool_handle` (`compose.ail:758`), registered as the hook at
`:839`, and dispatched by the core runtime at `src/core/ext/runtime.ail:338`.

**C12's replacement is buildable but incorrectly biased — ruled at R1.** The *distinction* obligation
2 draws (hermeticity inventory ≠ architecture discovery) is sound and is the most valuable sentence
in the correction; the tool it recommends does not have the property the argument needs, though for a
different reason than the OPEN DEFECT states, and the honest primary detector today is the
conservative textual inventory D5 currently disparages. D5 *can* name a buildable primary detector —
it is just not the one it names. Obligations 1 and 3 are unaffected and correct.

**The enumeration is complete, with one omission.** `git show --stat d3bd9cd` touches only three
documents (this ADR, the review handoff, `REPLY-546-park-unbounded-drain.md`) and `5eadee7` only two;
the working tree is clean, and `git diff --stat 7b9b4a4c..HEAD -- src packages scripts Makefile
.github` still returns only the four files the handoff lists. No source moved under this review. I
found no corrected text outside C1–C14 plus the two `5eadee7` ADR edits — except that the handoff
discloses only the D6.1 narrowing as post-dating `d3bd9cd`, while `5eadee7` also added the
Status-block paragraph at ADR:18-22 announcing the open defect. Its content is disclosed elsewhere
in the handoff, so this is an enumeration gap rather than an undisclosed edit. The caveat that
remains unclosable: with no pre-correction blob I can certify that each cited location *contains what
the table describes*, not that the table describes everything that *changed* there.

**Confirmed sound, re-executed:**

- **C5.** Five `emit_run_summary` call sites at `1325`, `1554`, `1704`, `1711`, `1762` (`:833` is the
  definition). `1554` is the success path (`result: Ok(st.msgs)`); `1325` is inside `c2_fail`
  (`:1301`), so call sites genuinely do not equal terminal paths. Both direct returns check out:
  invalid history at `1528-1531` and the approval-state invariant at `1614-1616`, each returning with
  no summary emitted.
- **C6, the parts that hold.** `148-154` is `live_ports` with the `stepWithStream` call at `:152`;
  `157-168` is `scripted_ports_from_steps` exactly; `192-199` is the one-arm `dispatch_step` exactly.
  Three of five ranges exact — see R4 and R7 for the other two.
- **C9.** The narrowing is defensible, not an over-correction. `env_get` is
  `(string, string) -> string ! {Env}` and `approval_read` is
  `(ApprovalRequest) -> ApprovalResolution ! {IO}` (`src/core/ports.ail:19-21`) — neither has an
  intermediate multi-fire channel through which a value can be silently discarded, which is the loss
  the rule is about. `env_get`'s missing-versus-empty conflation is real but is a *modeling* gap in
  the world's synthetic environment, not a discarded-emission loss, and belongs to D1's `world_state`
  contract rather than to this rule. No contradiction with D1's own bullets: `ADR:351-353` preserves
  `ApprovalResolution` and the point clock read unchanged, and `ADR:349-350` names `tool_exec`'s
  widening on the separate `ToolCallEnvelope`/deadline ground exactly as C9 says.
- **C3, verified per finding (A6).** Every one of F1–F6 has a locatable response where C3 claims:
  F1 at ADR:227-234, F2 at ADR:296-322, F3 at ADR:607-620, F4 at ADR:621-641, F5 at ADR:905-914,
  F6 at ADR:236-244/245-254 and Implementation Handoff item 2 at ADR:1223-1228. No
  `## Spike-findings disposition` heading exists. C3 is a correct ruling, not a rationalization.
- **C14's handoff edits are additive (A7).** Each is marked as a correction over preserved history —
  "**Corrected 2026-08-01:**" at HANDOFF:22, "The review text is intentionally left as written — it
  is a historical record" at :200, "The contract below is retained as the historical record of what
  the three executed rounds were asked for" at :220. The original contract is legible as history and
  the executed rounds are not made to look like they were asked for something else. R6 is the single
  exception, and it is a factual overstatement rather than a rewrite.
- **C1/C2, apart from R6.** The D6.1 narrowing is correct (grounded at R6). I checked the remaining
  "all three" claims for the same overstatement and found none: Claude rules on the narrowed
  blocking clause at ADR:2531, on the upstream return shape at ADR:2557-2562, and on M2 at
  ADR:2564-2570, matching Codex and Kimi.
- **C4.** The retraction is accurate and the falsified completeness claim is stated in the ADR's own
  voice rather than paraphrased.
- **C10.** Softened as described — but see R2 for what it now propagates.
- **Five prior `## Review Comments` sections counted directly before appending this one.**

**Process finding, not an ADR defect.** The handoff is right that the unretrievable blob is a
mechanical consequence of Kimi's R8. The cost is concrete and lands on this review: three of my seven
findings (R4, R5, R7) are anchor errors that a two-line diff would have surfaced in seconds, and I
had to re-derive every one of the fourteen corrections from prose to find them. Commit acceptance
records before they are reviewed, one commit per pass.

## Recommended pre-acceptance actions

**This ADR must fix, in dependency order:**

1. **R1 — repair D5 obligation 2.** Everything else in D5 and D4's clock gate depends on which
   detector is named. Replace the call-graph recommendation with the site-level textual inventory,
   state `src` + `packages` as profile roots, state the soundness boundary, name effect-row
   reconciliation as successor.
2. **R2 — then delete or propagate the non-citability markers.** Cannot be done before (1), because
   what the markers say depends on whether obligation 2 is repaired.
3. **R3 — reconcile C8, C9, and item 1** on the interim cursor mechanism. Independent of (1) and (2)
   and can proceed in parallel, but must land before the implementation plan is written, because item
   2 is sequenced first in that plan and is currently unbuildable as specified.
4. **R4, R5, R7 — correct the three anchor ranges.** Mechanical; all three verified above.
5. **R6 — narrow HANDOFF:216.** Mechanical.

**Belongs to the implementation plan, not this ADR:**

- Constructing the ambient-effect inventory itself, and pinning its output format so it can be
  diffed gate-to-gate. This ADR names the detector; the plan builds it.
- The deferred `stub_step.ail:171-172` / `190-191` comment fix, with this ADR's anchors into that
  file re-grounded in the same change. Track it as a work item — it currently exists only as prose
  inside a proposed ADR.
- The declared-versus-performed effect-row reconciliation gate, and closing the
  `agents_md.walk_agents` under-declaration (`src/core/agents_md.ail:106-110`) that demonstrates why
  it is needed.
- `ExtPorts.clock_now`'s first use. Zero invocations repo-wide means the seam that must route nine of
  the thirteen reads has never executed; budget for it changing shape on first contact, as D4 says.

## Accept / revise recommendation

**Revise** — R1 and R3 are substantive and change what the ADR requires, R2 leaves a retracted claim
reachable from two unmarked places, and R4/R5/R7 are three more anchor errors in a re-grounding pass
whose stated purpose was anchor precision; none is architectural, and the architecture, the F1–F6
dispositions, and C11's now-correct clock measurement all survive this pass intact. The upstream
recorded-stream API blocker is untouched by this review and is not clearable here: it remains open,
parked, unmerged, and external, D1 still requires it to land in a *release* with the toolchain
repinned before acceptance, the `arniwesth/ailang` fork's `stepWithStream` on `v0.31.0` does not
satisfy that, and it therefore continues to block acceptance independently of every finding above.

## Review Comments

_Reviewer: Codex (model: `GPT-5`), 2026-08-01. Independent delta verification of the F1-F6
correction pass. This is the seventh section in the working tree: five historical sections exist at
HEAD, and an uncommitted sixth section authored by Claude Code was already present when this review
started._

_ADR body reviewed at commit `5eadee76dc66d687d697e277784e82a991d79bfb`; correction commit
`d3bd9cd2`. Toolchain: AILANG v0.26.0, commit
`3b52a24d24431c372ed5605289ef039592209514`._

### R1. D5 still names no conservatively over-approximate routing detector, and D4 continues to rely on that unsupported bias

**Defect:** D5 obligation 2 and D4's clock gate require an over-approximate source/ABI inventory,
but the available graph is a regex approximation with incomplete call resolution and profiles that
do not cover the required source roots; the marked defect's dropped `ports.model_step` edge is real,
but that routed seam call is not itself an ambient-effect site and does not identify the detector the
gate can soundly use.

**Grounding:** `tools/code-graph/extractor/source_parser.py:176-199` drops a dotted call when the
prefix is not an import binding; `tools/code-graph/extractor/config.py:12-17` defines `core` as only
`src/core` and `all` as `src`, `scripts`, `examples`, and `packages`. Executed against the parser:

```text
$ python3 - <<'PY'
... parse default core and all profiles; count std/clock.now rows; parse stub_step invokes ...
PY
core_now_rows= 5
all_src_packages_now_rows= 13
stub_model_step_edges= []
```

The same parser finds all thirteen direct `now()` sites when supplied the broad file set, showing
why the dropped port edge and the ambient-site inventory are different questions. It nevertheless
does not promise conservative coverage: it recognizes calls only through the import-resolution
cases at `source_parser.py:181-199`, and its shipped `core` scope omits the eight package sites D4
requires. Effect rows cannot be the primary detector at HEAD either:
`src/core/agents_md.ail:106-117` calls `fileExists` while declaring no `{FS}` row.

**Action:** Replace obligation 2's unspecified function-level/call-graph preference with a
conservative textual inventory of ambient-effect imports and call names over explicit profile roots,
including production code in `src/core/test/**` and every selected extension package. Treat an
ambient import or unresolved effectful call as a fail-closed candidate for manual triage, state the
soundness boundary, and name declared-versus-performed effect-row reconciliation as the successor
detector. Repair D4:601-604 at the same time so it no longer asserts an unavailable bias.

### R2. C8 and C13 name a cursor home but not an executable state-transition shape

**Defect:** Returning a successor cursor from a widened `model_step` cannot thread it through the
next provider call because the current port accepts no cursor input, while storing the cursor inside
a successor `Ports` closure is exactly the second home C8 prohibits.

**Grounding:** `src/core/ports.ail:17-24` defines
`model_step: (string, [Message], callback) -> Result[...]` with no state parameter;
`src/core/session.ail:338-357` gives `C2LoopState` only `provider: Ports` and no scripted-state field;
and `src/core/test/scripted_ports.ail:38-48` demonstrates the required shape as
`scripted_model_next(state) -> {result, next}`. D1 says the cursor must be an explicit
`C2LoopState` field and not closure-captured (ADR:235-243), while Handoff item 2 says merely that a
record return can carry next-state (ADR:1223-1228).

**Action:** Specify that the interim provider operation takes the current scripted/provider state
and returns its successor alongside `emissions` and the outcome, with the sole persistent value in
the named `C2LoopState` field. Update Handoff item 1 to distinguish the behaviour-preserving emission
widening from this additional bidirectional state-threading change, and reconcile C9's separately
named widening grounds.

### R3. C11's count is repo-wide, not a demonstrated default-profile-reachable set

**Defect:** The thirteen-site number is exact across `src` and `packages`, but D4 incorrectly calls
all thirteen reachable under the default profile even though the checked-in default installs neither
`compose` nor `test_dummy`, and no checked-in profile installs both.

**Grounding:** The wider sweep returned thirteen direct call sites: four in `session.ail`, one in
`ext/runtime.ail`, and eight in `motoko-ext-compose`; the only `std/clock` import outside that set is
the out-of-profile `scripts/smoke_ports_record.ail`. Configuration and registry execution show the
scope mismatch:

```text
$ sed -n '36,39p' .motoko/config/default/config.json
  "extensions": {
    "order": ["empty_stop_guard", "progress_contract_guard", "compaction_ai", "context_mode", "exa_search", "scratchpad", "compaction_structural"],
    "strict": false

$ rg -n 'test_dummy|"compose"' .motoko/config -g 'config.json'
.motoko/config/ailang/config.json:45:      "compose"
```

`src/core/ext/registry_generated.ail:51-69` instantiates only names present in that order.
`src/core/ext/runtime.ail:187-198,206,222,245,287,374` performs the fifth read only for a hook whose
id is `test_dummy`; `packages/motoko-ext-compose/compose.ail:756-758,816-840` makes the other eight
reachable only when `compose` is installed.

**Action:** Relabel thirteen as the repo-wide `src` + `packages` inventory, or name and version the
specific D5 simulation profile whose extension set makes those sites reachable. Record per-profile
counts separately; do not use “default profile” for a set no current default configuration realizes.

### R4. C1 contradicts the live acceptance state recorded immediately below it

**Defect:** The Status block says the convergent defects are corrected and that only the upstream
release event blocks acceptance, while the same block requires a fresh delta review and marks D5's
routing audit as a non-citable open defect.

**Grounding:** ADR:4-10 says “those defects are corrected” and “One acceptance blocker remains”;
ADR:12-22 says the corrections have not been independently reviewed and that D5 remains defective
and cannot be cited as gate evidence.

**Action:** Say one *external substrate* blocker remains, while separately listing the correction
defects and their delta verification as internal pre-acceptance work. Do not claim the correction set
is complete until the resulting delta passes.

### R5. The handoff's supposedly exhaustive edit account omits two post-`d3bd9cd` ADR additions

**Defect:** The handoff discloses only the D6.1 narrowing as post-dating `d3bd9cd`, but `5eadee76`
also added a six-line Status paragraph and the fifteen-line D5 open-defect block.

**Grounding:** Executed diff:

```text
$ git diff --unified=0 d3bd9cd..HEAD -- .agent/projects/009_motoko_dst_execution/ADR-001-deterministic-test-world-architecture.md
@@ -14,3 +14,9 @@
 [D6.1 narrowing plus six-line “One correction carries a known open defect” paragraph]
@@ -784,0 +791,15 @@
 [fifteen-line “OPEN DEFECT in obligation 2” block]
```

The pre-correction blob remains unavailable, so C1-C14's exhaustiveness at `d3bd9cd` cannot be
mechanically certified; every enumerated location contains the described text, but there is no
object against which to prove that no other correction was made.

**Action:** Correct the post-commit edit account to enumerate all three ADR changes in `5eadee76`
and retain the explicit limitation that C1-C14 cannot be proven exhaustive without the missing blob.

### R6. C6's second-pass re-grounding still misstates two source ranges

**Defect:** The Context row overextends `play_chunks` into `assistant_count` and falsely says
`stub_step.ail:175-204` now contains only comments even though it includes the complete live
`dispatch_step` definition and the start of `prose_step`.

**Grounding:** Executed source excerpt:

```text
$ awk 'NR>=88 && NR<=99 || NR>=190 && NR<=204 {printf "%d:%s\n", NR, $0}' src/core/test/stub_step.ail
88:func play_chunks(...
96:}
98:pure func assistant_count(...
190:-- There is no `next_provider` to return: ...
192:export func dispatch_step(
198:  ports.model_step(model, msgs, on_chunk)
199:}
203:export pure func prose_step(text: string) -> ScriptedStep {
```

The other C6 ranges hold: `148-154` is `live_ports`, `157-168` is
`scripted_ports_from_steps`, and `192-199` is the one-arm pass-through. The serial core and blocking
MCP anchors also hold at `tool_phase.ail:302-357` and `motoko-ext-mcp/exec.ail:63-70,165-176`.

**Action:** Change `88-99` to `88-96`, and replace the “only comment text” claim with an accurate
description: `175-191` is the partly stale comment block, `192-199` is live `dispatch_step`, and
`203-204` begins `prose_step`.

### R7. C7's stale-comment and contradiction anchors are both off by one

**Defect:** The note cites `170-171` for two stale sentences and `189-190` for their contradiction,
but the stale sentences are `171-172` and the contradiction is `190-191`.

**Grounding:** `src/core/test/stub_step.ail:170` accurately says “Dispatch one step call through the
provider”; `:171-172` incorrectly promise an updated provider and threaded `next_provider`; `:189`
is only `--`; and `:190-191` state there is no `next_provider` to return.

**Action:** Change the ranges to `171-172` and `190-191`. Deferring the source edit remains sound,
but track it as an implementation work item and re-ground this ADR in the same source change.

### R8. C14's live handoff correction still overstates D6.1 verification

**Defect:** The corrected, live part of `HANDOFF-review-adr-001-f1-f6-revision.md` says D6.1 was
confirmed three times even though the ADR correctly narrowed that claim to two.

**Grounding:** HANDOFF:213-217 includes D6.1 among claims “independently confirmed three times.”
Codex verifies the zero-`RunSummary` claim at ADR:2825-2830 and Kimi at ADR:3201-3210; Claude's
section cites only D6.1's five-call-site count at ADR:2397-2401 and does not rule on zero returned
summaries.

**Action:** Narrow HANDOFF:215-217 to say D6.1 was confirmed by two of the three, matching ADR:13-16.

## What is accurate

**C11's numeric count and routing state are correct this time.** On pinned AILANG v0.26.0, the
wider `src` + `packages` sweep finds exactly thirteen direct `now()` call sites: four in
`src/core/session.ail` (`791`, `842`, `1991`, `2089`), one in `src/core/ext/runtime.ail` (`190`),
and eight in `motoko-ext-compose` (`compose.ail` six, `author_tools.ail` one,
`authoring/dispatcher.ail` one). There are no aliased `std/clock` imports. The only additional site
is `scripts/smoke_ports_record.ail:65`, outside the claimed source/package set. The replacement
attribution holds: `session.ail:791` is inside `derive_session_id`; `run_v2_with_conversation` calls
it at `:2293`; `conversation_loop_v2` performs no clock read.

“Nothing is routed at HEAD” also holds. This command exited 1 with no output:

```text
$ rg -n --glob '*.ail' '\.clock_now\s*\(' src packages scripts
[no output]
```

All `clock_now` hits are definitions, record fields, or the `p.clock_now` pass-through at
`session.ail:675`, not invocations. R3 concerns the set's profile label, not its count or routing
column.

**C12's replacement is not correctly biased as written, but a buildable primary detector exists.**
The distinction between architecture discovery and hermeticity inventory is sound. A conservative
textual import/call inventory over explicit semantic-profile roots can be built today and can
genuinely over-approximate by treating unresolved imports/calls as candidates. Effect rows are the
right eventual detector only after declared-versus-performed reconciliation closes accepted latent
under-declarations. Obligations 1 and 3 remain sound.

**The enumeration is not complete.** R5 identifies the definite post-`d3bd9cd` omissions. Because
the pre-correction blob was never written, no reviewer can prove C1-C14 exhaustive at the correction
commit; this is a process limitation, not an additional architecture defect.

The following corrections were also re-run and confirmed:

- **C3:** every F1-F6 response is locatable where claimed: F1 at ADR:224-243, F2 at :300-324, F3 at
  :607-619, F4 at :621-645, F5 at :893-917, and F6 at :235-254 plus Handoff item 2. The missing
  disposition heading was a bad reference, not a missing normative record.
- **C4:** the retraction accurately records that source moved under the ADR and that the blanket
  “rest verified unchanged” claim was false.
- **C5:** `emit_run_summary` has five call sites at `1325`, `1554`, `1704`, `1711`, and `1762`;
  `1325` is the shared `c2_fail` helper; `1554` is the success branch; and the direct returns at
  `1528-1531` and `1614-1616` emit no summary. Call sites do not equal terminal paths.
- **C7, disposition only:** deferring the contradictory source-comment edit is appropriate during a
  findings-only review; only its anchors are wrong (R7).
- **C9:** the loss-channel narrowing is defensible. `model_step` alone has the demonstrated
  multi-fire callback whose emissions are discarded. `env_get`'s fallback semantics are a modeling
  contract rather than a discarded intermediate channel, and `tool_exec` is widened on its separate
  typed-envelope/deadline ground. R2 requires an additional state-threading ground for
  `model_step`; it does not revive the rejected all-fields generalization.
- **C14, historical treatment:** the corrections are explicitly labeled and preserve the spent
  original contract as history. R8 is a remaining factual overstatement, not a rewrite of what the
  three executed rounds were asked to do.
- **C1/C2 ruling counts:** the D6.1 narrowing to two verifications is correct. The remaining listed
  F1/F2/F3/F5/F6, narrowed-blocker, upstream-return-shape, and M2 rulings are present in all three
  2026-08-01 sections. R4 concerns the current blocker count, not those historical ruling counts.

## Recommended pre-acceptance actions

**This ADR must fix, in dependency order:**

1. **R3:** define or name the semantic profile whose routing gate is being counted, then state its
   exact source/package roots; alternatively relabel thirteen as a repo-wide inventory.
2. **R1:** name the conservative textual detector and soundness boundary over those roots, then
   repair D4's dependent over-approximation claim and remove the non-citability marker only after the
   replacement is independently verified.
3. **R2:** specify the interim cursor operation's state-in/state-out shape and reconcile D1 with
   Handoff items 1-2 and C9's widening grounds.
4. **R4, R5, and R8:** correct the acceptance status, post-commit edit enumeration, and D6.1 count in
   the live handoff.
5. **R6 and R7:** correct the mechanical source anchors.

**Belongs to the implementation plan, not this ADR:**

- Build and pin the textual ambient-effect inventory for each versioned profile, with diffable
  output and fail-closed triage.
- Add declared-versus-performed effect-row reconciliation and close known under-declarations such as
  `agents_md.walk_agents`.
- Implement the bidirectional scripted-provider cursor transition and turn the existing F6 probe
  green without placing state in a closure.
- Delete the stale `stub_step.ail:171-172` comments, retain the accurate `:170`, and re-ground the ADR
  in that source change.
- Route the clock sites belonging to each named profile through the world seam and add first-contact
  conformance coverage for `ExtPorts.clock_now`.

## Accept / revise recommendation

**Revise.** C11's raw count and routing state now hold, but R1-R3 leave the hermeticity gate and
interim cursor mechanism underspecified or incorrectly scoped, and R4-R8 leave contradictory status,
provenance, and anchors. The upstream recorded-stream API blocker is unchanged and independently
continues to block acceptance: it remains open, parked, unmerged, and external; a fork prototype does
not clear the gate, which still requires the API to land in a release, the toolchain to be repinned,
and the positive integration probe to pass.

Toolchain `AILANG v0.26.0` (commit `3b52a24`), matching the pin. Scope is the corrected text alone.
F1/F2/F3/F5/F6, the narrowed D1 blocking clause, the upstream return-shape ruling, M2, D6.1's
zero-`RunSummary` claim, D4's count of 13, "nothing is routed at HEAD", corrections C3/C4/C5/C9/C14,
and the accepted 007 architecture are not reopened. Every claim below was executed at HEAD; nothing
is inherited from the handoff, from the spike branch, or from the seven prior sections. The
`.ailang` cache warning was honoured — all probe results below are from a clean scratch directory
outside the repo.

Having a real two-commit diff worked. Six of the previous round's fifteen findings were provenance
or anchor errors; this round has none, because the diff answered those questions directly.

### R1. The bidirectional widening has a second `Ports.model_step` call site the ADR does not account for, and it sits behind the extension ABI

**Defect:** D1's new paragraph and Implementation Handoff item 2 specify that `model_step` "must
take the current provider state and return its successor," with the sole persistent copy in a
`C2LoopState` field. There are **two** calls through that field, not one. The second —
`src/core/session.ail:662`, inside `ext_ai_step` — is reached from `ExtPorts.ai_step`, whose ABI
signature carries no state in either direction and cannot reach `C2LoopState`. The widening
therefore forces either an unbudgeted `ExtPorts` ABI change or a second, discarded copy of provider
state: precisely the "second home" D1 prohibits by name, arriving through a path the ADR never
mentions.

**Grounding:**

```text
$ grep -rn "\.model_step(" src packages --include=*.ail
src/core/session.ail:662:  match p.model_step(provider_api_model(model, base_url), msgs_to_messages(msgs), on_chunk) {
src/core/test/stub_step.ail:198:  ports.model_step(model, msgs, on_chunk)
```

`session.ail:654-666` defines `ext_ai_step(p: Ports, ...)`; `session.ail:668-677` wraps it as
`ExtPorts.ai_step`; that `ExtPorts` is constructed at four driver sites from loop state:

```text
$ grep -n "ext_ports_of" src/core/session.ail
668:func ext_ports_of(p: Ports, base_url: string) -> ExtPorts ! {...}
1622: ... ext_ports_of(st.provider, policy.step.provider_base_url), ...
1649: ... ext_ports_of(st.provider, policy.step.provider_base_url), ...
1696: ... ext_ports_of(st.provider, policy.step.provider_base_url), ...
1778: ... ext_ports_of(st.provider, policy.step.provider_base_url), ...
```

The ABI signature admits no state (`packages/motoko-ext-abi/types.ail:63`):

```text
  ai_step: (string, [Msg]) -> Result[string, string] ! {AI, IO, Process, FS, Env, Net, SharedMem, Clock, Stream},
```

The ADR's only contemplated change to this field is an effect-row addition — ADR:1290 lists
"`ExtPorts.ai_step` gains `Trace`" among the repin's ABI major. A state parameter is nowhere
budgeted. The Context row corrected in this pass compounds the problem by asserting `:198` "is the
sole `ports.model_step` call": literally true of the identifier `ports`, false of the seam, and D1's
whole argument turns on the seam's singularity.

**Action:** In D1, state which of the two dispositions applies to `ext_ai_step`: (a) `ExtPorts.ai_step`
widens too, in which case say so and move it into the ABI-major budget in *Consequences* alongside
the `Trace` row; or (b) the extension AI path is explicitly declared out of the state-threaded
provider seam — a fixed non-scripted sub-provider whose calls do not advance the cursor — in which
case say why an extension-issued model call may skip the script without diverging replay. Silence is
not an option here, because a discarded successor at `:662` is the exact defect F6 records. Also
re-word the Context row: `:198` is the sole call *in `dispatch_step`*, not the sole call through the
field.

### R2. The state type the widening names cannot be seen by the two modules that must declare and thread it — the module graph forbids it and the generic escape does not typecheck

**Defect:** D1 points at `scripted_model_next(state) -> {result, next}`
(`src/core/test/scripted_ports.ail:38-48`) as "the shape the port lacks at both ends," and item 2
says `ScriptedPortsState` "already models the threaded cursor in the required shape." Neither
`src/core/ports.ail` (which must declare the widened field) nor `src/core/session.ail` (which must
hold the `C2LoopState` field and construct initial state at `ported_provider`) can import that type:
`scripted_ports.ail` imports both, and AILANG rejects the cycle. The obvious escape — parameterising
`Ports` over the state type — does not typecheck on the pin.

**Grounding:** the import edges that close the cycle:

```text
$ grep -n "^import src/core" src/core/test/scripted_ports.ail
13:import src/core/ports (ApprovalResolution, ApprovalAllowed, ApprovalDenied, Ports, ports_shape_probe)
15:import src/core/test/stub_step (...)
18:import src/core/session as Session
```

`ScriptedStep` — the payload of `ScriptedPortsState.model_steps` — is declared at
`src/core/test/stub_step.ail:34`, and `stub_step.ail:23` imports `src/core/ports`, so it is not
visible in `ports.ail` either. The compiler rejects the cycle (clean scratch dir, no repo cache):

```text
$ ailang check cyc/a.ail
Error: dependency cycle: LDR002: dependency cycle detected: cyc/a -> cyc/b -> cyc/a -> ...
```

A parameterised record declaration is accepted but its instantiation is unusable — both annotation
and field access fail:

```text
$ cat p4.ail
module p4
export type PortsG[s] = { model_step: (string, s) -> { result: int, next: s } }
export func use(p: PortsG[int], st: int) -> int { (p.model_step("m", st)).result }
...
$ ailang check p4.ail
Error: type error in p4 (decl 0): type unification failed at [field access at p4.ail:8:5]:
cannot unify type application PortsG[int] with { model_step: α1, | r }
```

(An annotated `let` fails the same way: `cannot unify old record type with *types.TApp`.) There are
no parameterised record types anywhere in the tree —
`grep -rnE "^(export )?type [A-Za-z_]+\[[a-z]" src packages` returns nothing — so this is unprecedented
as well as unsupported. Compounding it, `state_from_step_provider`
(`scripted_ports.ail:30-36`), the only existing initial-state constructor, is unreachable from the
driver for the same cycle reason: `grep -rn "src/core/test/scripted_ports" src --include=*.ail`
outside `src/core/test/` returns nothing, and `session.ail` imports only `stub_step` (`:133`).

**What does work.** The shape composes fine with a record of closures and with recursive state
threading, provided the state type is **concrete and declared in `src/core/ports.ail` or below**. A
three-module probe mirroring the real layering (`ports` → `stub` → `session`, live and scripted
adapters, a recursive driver threading the successor through one loop-state field) typechecks and
effect-checks clean at v0.26.0:

```text
$ ailang check lay/session.ail
→ Type checking lay/session.ail...
→ Effect checking...
✓ No errors found!
```

**Action:** Say in D1 (or in item 2) that the widening requires a concrete `ProviderState` type
declared in `src/core/ports.ail`, that `ScriptedStep` must move to `ports.ail` or a module below it
to make that possible, and that `ScriptedPortsState`/`scripted_model_next`/`state_from_step_provider`
are a *design precedent* rather than reusable code — the current text reads as if they can be wired
in. Both are relocations of source under this ADR, the pattern the Status block already names as the
source of its stale anchors, so budget them in item 2 rather than discovering them during
implementation.

### R3. The live adapter's successor is unspecified, and `ported_provider` has no way to produce an initial state for two of its three arms

**Defect:** `live_ports` is stateless — it wraps `stepWithStream` and holds nothing
(`src/core/test/stub_step.ail:148-155`). The ADR never says what it returns as successor state, so
every construction site now carries a field with no stated meaning on the live path. Separately,
`ported_provider` returns a bare `Ports` and is the single funnel for all six construction sites; its
`Ported(p) => p` and `LiveAI => live_ports(rt)` arms have no script from which an initial state could
be derived, and the ADR does not say who initialises the new `C2LoopState` field for them.

**Grounding:** `src/core/session.ail:695-701`:

```text
func ported_provider(rt: ExtRuntime, history: [Message], provider: StepProvider) -> Ports {
  match provider {
    Ported(p) => p,
    LiveAI => live_ports(rt),
    Scripted(script) => scripted_ports_from_steps(history, script)
  }
}
```

called at `2015, 2051, 2114, 2137, 2267, 2295` — all six confirmed. Only the `Scripted` arm carries
a script. The identity answer does work — the layered probe above has `live_ports` return
`next: st` unchanged and it typechecks — so this is a specification gap, not an impossibility.

**Action:** One sentence in D1: the live and caller-supplied adapters return their input state
unchanged, and `ported_provider` returns the initial state alongside the `Ports` (or a paired
constructor does), with the empty state used for `LiveAI`/`Ported`. Name it explicitly rather than
leaving six sites to infer it.

### R4. The new "profile-reachable" definition does not classify the `test_dummy` read, and the D4 table's own "reachable when" column contradicts it

**Defect:** ADR:751-759 defines a read as profile-reachable "when it occurs in the core driver or in
a module the profile *installs*", and explicitly rules out "a read some execution path can actually
perform". Two uses in the same section do not satisfy that definition.

(a) `src/core/ext/runtime.ail:190` is in neither category: `runtime.ail` is a core module present in
every profile, and what is conditionally installed is a *hook*, not a module. Read literally, the
definition makes that read profile-reachable always — which contradicts "a profile installing no
clock-reading extension has four sites to route" (ADR:687-688). It is five under the definition as
written.

(b) The table row for `compose` gives its reachability condition as "`compose` is installed **and**
the model calls `Compose`" (ADR:671). The second conjunct is exactly the execution-path test the
definition forbids, and the prose sixteen lines later drops it: "one installing `compose` has
twelve" counts all eight on installation alone. Both cannot be right.

**Grounding:** the read is gated on hook identity, not on module installation
(`src/core/ext/runtime.ail:187-198`):

```text
187:func emit_dummy_hook(hook: string, key: string, val: string) -> () ! {IO, Clock} {
190:    kv("ts", jnum(intToFloat(now()))),
197:func is_test_dummy(hook_id: string) -> bool {
198:  hook_id == "test_dummy" || startsWith(hook_id, "test_dummy#")
```

with six call sites all of the form `if is_test_dummy(h.id) then emit_dummy_hook(...)` (`:206, 222,
239/245, 280/287, 368/374`).

**Action:** Extend the definition to hooks: a read is profile-reachable when it occurs in the core
driver, in a module the profile installs, **or in a core code path guarded solely by an installed
hook's identity**. Then delete "and the model calls `Compose`" from the table's `compose` row so the
column states an installation condition throughout, and confirm in the text that the four/twelve
arithmetic assumes `test_dummy` is not installed. Choosing the other resolution — making the read
unconditionally reachable — would change the stated four to five, so the choice must be made
explicitly rather than left to the reader.

### R5. D5 obligation 2 names a detector whose detection set is never enumerated, and its stated soundness boundary omits out-of-tree AILANG package source

**Defect:** Obligation 2 requires "a conservative textual inventory of **ambient-effect imports** and
call names". That term appears nowhere else in a defining role — the ADR never enumerates which
imports are ambient-effect-bearing, never says whether the set is fixed or pinned to a toolchain
version, and never addresses aliased imports or re-export chains. A detector whose detection set is
undefined is not buildable, and the sole gate that would catch a missing entry is the same detector.
Separately, the stated boundary ("blind outside the AILANG tree; does not decide reachability") is
incomplete: a registry dependency's source is AILANG and is under neither scan root.

**Grounding:** the only adjacent enumeration is per-profile and is a *forbidden* list, not an
ambient-bearing one (ADR:782, inside "A versioned profile definition records"): "forbidden ambient
effects/capabilities during execution". Obligation 2 does not reference it. An enumerable set does
exist and the ADR does not cite it (`ailang.toml:54`):

```text
[effects]
max = ["IO", "Env", "AI", "Net", "FS", "Process", "SharedMem", "Clock", "Stream", "SharedIndex", "Rand", "Trace"]
```

The scan-root gap:

```text
$ grep -n "sunholo/logging" ailang.toml
9:"sunholo/logging" = "0.4.0"
```

Every other dependency is `{ path = "packages/..." }`; `sunholo/logging` resolves from the registry,
so its source is under neither `src` nor `packages` while being AILANG — a case the "outside the
AILANG tree (TypeScript child processes, MCP subprocesses, shelled binaries)" clause does not
describe. Exposure today is nil: `grep -rn "sunholo/logging" src packages --include=*.ail` returns
only `src/examples/test_logging/test_logging.ail:3`, out of profile. The gate is the point, not the
current tree.

On aliasing: there are no aliased `std/clock` imports at HEAD — all five are the bare form
`import std/clock (now)` (`session.ail:30`, `ext/runtime.ail:3`, `compose/author_tools.ail:3`,
`compose/compose.ail:5`, `compose/authoring/dispatcher.ail:4`) — so nothing is missed today, but
obligation 2 says nothing about the aliased or `as`-qualified forms it would have to handle.

On the `ExtPorts`-closure question the handoff raises: that case is *covered*. An effect reached
through a closure supplied by a scanned package is still written literally at a site inside that
package, so a site-granularity textual inventory over `src` + `packages` sees it. This is the one
part of the boundary that holds without amendment, and it is worth stating in the ADR since the
previous two attempts turned on exactly this confusion.

**Action:** Enumerate the ambient-effect import set in obligation 2 — cite `[effects] max` from
`ailang.toml` as the pinned source and name the corresponding modules (`std/clock`, `std/fs`,
`std/process`, `std/net`, `std/env`, `std/io`, `std/ai`, and whatever `SharedMem`/`Rand`/`Stream`
surface as) — and state that repinning the toolchain requires re-deriving it, tying that to the
ABI-major milestone the Consequences section already budgets. Specify that the inventory matches on
the import *target module* rather than on bound symbol names, so aliased and qualified forms are
covered by construction. Add out-of-tree AILANG package source as a third named limit alongside the
two already stated, with the profile obliged to declare any registry dependency it installs.

### R6. The re-corrected stale-comment note fixes two lines and leaves a third that is stale by the same test

**Defect:** The *Known stale source comment* note now instructs "Delete `171-172` only."
`src/core/test/stub_step.ail:173` is stale for the identical reason — it describes a parameter
`89a1d67` removed from the same function — and the note's emphasis that "the exact ranges matter to
whoever executes this fix" makes an incomplete range a defect rather than a nit.

**Grounding:** the live signature takes no `rt` (`src/core/test/stub_step.ail:192-199`):

```text
192:export func dispatch_step(
193:  ports: Ports,
194:  model: string,
195:  msgs: [Message],
196:  on_chunk: (StreamChunk) -> () ! {IO, Trace}
197:) -> Result[StepResult, AIError] ! {AI, IO, Trace} {
```

while `:173` still reads "rt is forwarded to tools_with_extensions so extension tools appear in the
LLM catalog." The pre-commit signature confirms `rt` was a real parameter of *this* function:

```text
$ git show 89a1d67~1:src/core/test/stub_step.ail | grep -n "func dispatch_step" -A 6
180:export func dispatch_step(
181-  provider: StepProvider,
182-  model: string,
183-  msgs: [Message],
184-  rt: ExtRuntime,
185-  on_chunk: (StreamChunk) -> () ! {IO, Trace}
186-) -> { result: Result[StepResult, AIError], next_provider: StepProvider } ! {AI, IO, Trace} {
```

**Action:** Change the note to "Delete `171-173`." `:170` remains accurate and must survive, as the
note correctly says.

## What is accurate

Everything re-run below was executed at HEAD `139d449` on the clean tree.

**A1 — is the bidirectional widening buildable as specified? No, but it is buildable.** Ruling in
three parts. The *shape* composes: a record-of-closures field taking state and returning
`{result, next, emissions}`, threaded through a recursive driver holding one state field, typechecks
and effect-checks clean on pinned v0.26.0 across a three-module probe that mirrors the real
`ports`→`stub_step`→`session` layering. A closure can accept state it did not capture, and the
successor threads without a second home appearing. What fails is everything the ADR left unsaid: the
state type is not expressible where the ADR points it (R2), the live adapter's successor and the
initial state for four of six construction sites are unspecified (R3), and a second call through the
seam sits behind an ABI that cannot carry state (R1). R1 is the one that could change the plan
rather than just the prose. The sequencing decision — this before the repin, as a change distinct
from the emission widening — is right, and D1's grounds for separating them (state threading is not
a loss channel) are correctly stated and correctly kept out of the loss-channel rule's scope.

**A2 — is D5 obligation 2 specified well enough to build? Not yet, but it is close, and the
diagnosis it now rests on is correct.** The overturn is verified in full. `_binding_maps`
(`source_parser.py:164-173`) populates `bare[sym]` for every non-aliased import, and `_resolve_call`
(`:193-196`) resolves bare `std` calls, so `now()` under `import std/clock (now)` is seen — the
second pass's fail-open claim was wrong and the correction is right to withdraw it. Both replacement
disqualifiers hold: `PROFILES["core"] = ("src/core",)` (`config.py:13-17`, `packages` appears only
under `"all"`), and the granularity claim is exact — the plain-call path dedups on
`(from_slug, target, member)` via `seen` (`source_parser.py:248, 257-261`) while the interpolation
path at `:275-281` has no `seen` check at all. What is missing is the detection set itself (R5). The
`ExtPorts`-closure sub-question resolves in the correction's favour.

**A3 — does the new "profile-reachable" definition hold everywhere the term is used? Not everywhere
— two of five uses fail, both inside D4.** The acceptance-table rows survive it. *Is the tested
boundary honest?* (ADR:1190, "every profile-reachable hook") reads correctly under installation
scoping, since hooks are the thing a profile installs; the definition does not change what that row
demands. *Does virtual time matter?* (ADR:1192) says "every time-bearing read reachable in the
profile", which the definition governs and which is satisfied by it. D5's clock bullet (ADR:828-831)
is explicitly installation-derived and consistent. The two failures are the `test_dummy`
classification and the `compose` row's execution-path conjunct (R4). On the trade: **installation
scoping is the right choice.** It is the conservative direction — it forces routing work for reads
no run reaches, which fails closed — it is decidable from artifacts that exist today, and it is the
only choice consistent with D5 obligation 3 declining to require a reachability analysis. It does not
make any existing profile unachievable: the default profile installs no clock-reading extension, so
its obligation is the four driver reads (five, once R4(a) is resolved), and no checked-in profile
installs `compose` except `.motoko/config/ailang`.

**A4 — the configuration facts, re-derived independently.** All hold.
`.motoko/config/default/config.json:37` lists exactly `empty_stop_guard, progress_contract_guard,
compaction_ai, context_mode, exa_search, scratchpad, compaction_structural` — no `compose`.
`compose` appears in exactly one checked-in config, `.motoko/config/ailang/config.json:41-46`.
`test_dummy` appears in no checked-in config: `grep -rn "test_dummy" .motoko/config/*/config.json`
is empty. `parse_tokens` (`registry_generated.ail:51-65`) instantiates only names resolved from the
configured order (`resolve(name, cfg)` at `:56`, `None => skip`), so an unlisted extension is never
constructed. No checked-in configuration realizes all thirteen — confirmed. The arithmetic is right
under installation scoping: 4 + 8 = 12, and excluding `test_dummy` is correct because no config
installs it. The count and split were re-derived from scratch and match: fourteen `now()` hits across
`src` + `packages`, of which `session.ail:785` is comment text, leaving 13 sites — 4 in
`session.ail` (`791, 842, 1991, 2089`), 1 in `ext/runtime.ail` (`190`), 8 in `motoko-ext-compose`
(`compose.ail:362, 503, 597, 651, 681, 767`; `author_tools.ail:101`;
`authoring/dispatcher.ail:217`).

**A5 — anchors.** Every anchor introduced or changed in `5db6706` was re-run. All exact except as
noted in R6. `registry_generated.ail:51-65` is `parse_tokens`, opening and closing on those lines.
`scripted_ports.ail:38-48` is `scripted_model_next`, and its return shape is literally
`{ result: ..., next: ... }`. `config.py:13-17` is the `PROFILES` dict. `source_parser.py:176-199` is
`_resolve_call`, exactly. `agents_md.ail:106` is `func walk_agents(current: string, acc: [string]) ->
[string]` with no effect row, calling `fileExists` at `:109` — the under-declaration is real and
v0.26.0 accepts it. `ports.ail:18` is the `model_step` field. In `stub_step.ail`: `88-96` is
`play_chunks` exactly (the previous `88-99` overshot into `assistant_count` at `:98`; corrected);
`148-154` is `live_ports` with `stepWithStream` at `:152`; `157-168` is
`scripted_ports_from_steps`; `192-199` is `dispatch_step` in full — the fix for the previous pass's
false "contains only comment text" claim is correct, and the new split (`175-191` comment,
`192-199` function, `203-204` opens `prose_step`) is exact. The stale-comment note's corrected
ranges are right as far as they go: `:171-172` are the two stale lines, `:190-191` the
contradicting pair, `:170` accurate and must survive, `:189` a bare `--`. "Eighteen lines later"
checks out (172→190). The previous ranges would indeed have deleted `:170` and left `:172`.

**A6 — the Status block.** No self-contradiction, and no contradiction with the body. The two-blocker
split is coherent and matches ADR:78 ("the upstream recorded-stream API and an independent review").
Numbering the internal item as a blocker rather than following Codex R4's narrower phrasing is a
defensible strengthening, not a regression. The "settled" list is accurate: D6.1 is now correctly
attributed to "two of the three," matching the delta reviews' finding; the F1/F2/F3/F5/F6, narrowed
blocking clause, upstream return shape, and M2 attributions to all three hold; the delta reviews'
confirmations of D4's count and of C3/C4/C5/C9/C14 are correctly reported. The "no exhaustive-edit
table, deliberately" paragraph discloses the previous table's omission accurately and the diff is
now the record — which is what let this review skip six of the previous round's fifteen findings.
`HANDOFF-review-adr-001-f1-f6-revision.md:216` no longer overstates D6.1 (Claude R6 / Codex R8
answered), and `HANDOFF-delta-review-adr-001-f1-f6-corrections.md` is correctly marked spent with its
A1 preserved as a recorded misdiagnosis.

**A7 — collateral.** The withdrawn over-approximation claim is gone from both places it lived. D4's
detector sentence (ADR:652-653) now says "a conservative textual site inventory over explicit `src` +
`packages` roots, per D5 obligation 2" and defers rather than restating a bias; D5's routing-audit
bullet (ADR:826-827) asserts no bias at all; the clock bullet (ADR:828-831) is derived from the
profile's extension list. They agree with obligation 2 and with each other. Consolidating the
non-citability marker into D5 alone is sound given D4 now defers to it. The 007 pillar-1 row
("capability/routing audits", ADR:1173) is generic enough to remain true. The acceptance row at
ADR:1192 cites "the routing audit" as gate evidence, which is exactly what the Status block and the
D5 verification gate declare non-citable until verified — consistent, and correctly flagged rather
than silently broken.

**One thing the history vindicates.** The pre-`89a1d67` `dispatch_step` returned
`{ result, next_provider: StepProvider }` — a successor *provider value*, the arrangement D1 now
prohibits by name. D1's prohibition is not hypothetical; it is a retrospective judgement on code
this repo actually shipped, and R1's `ext_ai_step` gap is the same defect trying to come back
through the extension seam.

## Recommended pre-acceptance actions

**This ADR must fix, in dependency order:**

1. **R1** — decide `ext_ai_step`'s disposition. It is first because it can move the widening from the
   pre-repin group into the ABI-major milestone, which changes the sequencing D1 just set.
2. **R2 and R3** — with (1) settled, state the concrete `ProviderState` type, its module home, the
   `ScriptedStep` relocation it implies, the live/`Ported` successor, and who constructs the initial
   state. These are two or three sentences in D1 plus a line in item 2.
3. **R4** — extend the profile-reachable definition to hook-guarded core paths, delete the execution
   conjunct from the `compose` row, and reconcile four-versus-five.
4. **R5** — enumerate the ambient-effect import set from `ailang.toml`'s `[effects] max`, specify
   target-module matching, and add out-of-tree package source as a third boundary limit.
5. **R6** — one-character range fix.

**Belongs to the implementation plan, not this ADR:**

- Building and pinning the textual inventory, its output format, and its manual-triage workflow.
- The `ScriptedStep`/`ProviderState` source relocation R2 requires, and re-grounding this ADR's
  `stub_step.ail` anchors in the same change as the `:171-173` deletion.
- Declared-versus-performed effect-row reconciliation and the `agents_md.ail:106` under-declaration
  it would catch.
- `ExtPorts.clock_now`'s first use — still zero call sites repo-wide, so the seam that must route
  nine of thirteen reads remains unexercised.

## Recommendation

**Revise** — the third correction pass answers all fifteen delta-review findings and its factual
claims hold, but R1 exposes a second seam call the widening cannot cross as designed, and R2/R3/R5
leave the two newly specified mechanisms underdetermined; all six findings are bounded text changes
to D1, D4, and D5, and none reopens the architecture. **The upstream API blocker is unchanged and
untouched by this review**: it remains open, external, and not clearable here — the fork's working
`stepWithStreamRecorded` on `v0.31.0` is a prototype, and D1 still requires the API in a *release*,
the toolchain repinned, and the positive integration probe passing. R1 may enlarge what that repin
must carry, but it does not clear it.

## Review Comments

_Reviewer: Codex (model: `GPT-5`), 2026-08-01. **Ninth independent delta review of the third
correction pass**, explicitly authorized after the repository was found to contain an eighth review.
The eighth section is preserved unchanged and was not treated as verification evidence for this
review._

Reviewed correction target `139d4498d3c801cb7b969fd579c6b4a87b9b8a18`, baseline `4ea8862`.
Current repository HEAD was `d7647d948e949772e2aa6a701edf93eb290a47dd`, whose only delta from the
target is the historical eighth review. The correction range was therefore held fixed rather than
allowing that appended review to enter the target:

```

The compiler used below was pinned `AILANG v0.26.0` at commit `3b52a24`. Every repository
`.ailang/cache` directory was deleted before the source check. The settled findings named in the
handoff were not reopened.

### R1. The bidirectional `model_step` widening cannot cross the existing extension-model path, so it is not buildable across the real driver as specified

**Defect:** D1 requires every provider operation to consume and return the sole driver-owned provider
state, but the second call through `Ports.model_step` is wrapped in `ExtPorts.ai_step` and then in
decision-only hook returns, none of which can return the successor to `C2LoopState`.

**Grounding:** the claimed single seam consumer is not single:

```text
$ rg -n '\.model_step\(' src packages -g '*.ail'
src/core/session.ail:662:  match p.model_step(provider_api_model(model, base_url), msgs_to_messages(msgs), on_chunk) {
src/core/test/stub_step.ail:198:  ports.model_step(model, msgs, on_chunk)
```

The second call is `ext_ai_step` (`src/core/session.ail:654-666`) wrapped by `ext_ports_of`
(`:668-677`). `ExtPorts.ai_step` returns only `Result[string, string]`
(`packages/motoko-ext-abi/types.ail:62-66`); `ExtensionHooks.on_pre_step` returns only
`PreStepDecision` (`:151-164`); and `PreStepChainResult` contains only `msgs`, `stages`, and
`artifacts` (`src/core/ext/runtime.ail:33`). This is a live provider path:
`packages/motoko-ext-compaction-ai/compaction_ai.ail:104-120` calls `ctx.ports.ai_step`, including
retries. Four core hook contexts receive `ext_ports_of(st.provider, ...)`:

```text
$ rg -n 'ext_ports_of\(' src/core/session.ail
668:func ext_ports_of(p: Ports, base_url: string) -> ExtPorts ! {AI, Clock, Env, FS, IO, Net, Process, SharedMem, Stream} {
1622: ... ext_ports_of(st.provider, policy.step.provider_base_url), ...
1649: ... ext_ports_of(st.provider, policy.step.provider_base_url), ...
1696: ... ext_ports_of(st.provider, policy.step.provider_base_url), ...
1778: ... ext_ports_of(st.provider, policy.step.provider_base_url), ...
```

Passing a state into the closure does not solve this path: discarding `next` recreates F6, while
capturing and replacing it inside the closure creates the second persistent home D1 prohibits.
The Context row at ADR:204 also calls `:198` the sole `ports.model_step` call; that is literally the
only receiver named `ports`, but it is not the sole call through the field and is misleading in the
architecture argument.

**Action:** D1 must choose and budget the extension path explicitly: either widen `ExtPorts.ai_step`,
the relevant hook result(s), and core dispatch results so the same token returns to `C2LoopState`
(placing those changes in the ABI-major milestone), or declare extension-issued model calls outside
the interim state-threaded seam and outside any conformant profile until the full world-token ABI
lands. In the latter case item 2 is only a partial cursor fix and must say so. Reword ADR:204 to say
`:198` is the sole `model_step` call in `dispatch_step`, not the sole seam call.

### R2. The concrete state type named as the implementation precedent is above both modules that must use it

**Defect:** `ScriptedPortsState` cannot be used as the widened field's parameter in `ports.ail` or as
the new driver field in `session.ail` without refactoring the module graph, yet D1 and handoff item 2
describe it as already modeling the required shape without naming the lower-layer replacement or
relocation.

**Grounding:** `src/core/test/scripted_ports.ail:13-18` imports `src/core/ports`,
`src/core/test/stub_step`, and `src/core/session`; `ScriptedPortsState` at `:20-24` contains
`ScriptedStep`, which is declared in `stub_step.ail:34-41`, and `stub_step.ail:23` itself imports
`ports.ail`. Importing the existing state type from either required consumer therefore closes a
cycle. A clean-cache two-module reproduction of that graph was rejected by the pinned compiler:

```text
$ ailang check cycle/a.ail
→ Type checking cycle/a.ail...
→ Effect checking...
Error: dependency cycle: LDR002: dependency cycle detected: cycle/a -> cycle/b -> cycle/a -> cycle/b -> cycle/a
```

The underlying design is viable when the state type is below the consumers. A separate three-module
scratch probe declared concrete `ProviderState`/`Ports` in `probe/ports`, live and scripted closures
in `probe/stub`, and an immutable recursive `LoopState` with one `provider_state` field in
`probe/session`:

```text
$ ailang check probe/session.ail
→ Type checking probe/session.ail...
→ Effect checking...

✓ No errors found!
```

**Action:** Name a concrete interim `ProviderState` in `src/core/ports.ail` or a lower shared module,
and say that the current `ScriptedPortsState`/`scripted_model_next` is a behavioral precedent rather
than directly reusable code. Handoff item 2 must budget the necessary `ScriptedStep`/state-helper
relocation or equivalent layering change; the implementation plan may select the exact syntax.

### R3. The live and caller-supplied provider arms have no specified initial state or successor semantics

**Defect:** `ported_provider` returns only `Ports`, so neither the stateless `LiveAI` arm nor the
arbitrary `Ported(p)` arm can initialize the new `C2LoopState` provider-state field, and D1 never says
what either adapter returns as its successor.

**Grounding:** `live_ports` captures no mutable state and directly returns `stepWithStream`
(`src/core/test/stub_step.ail:148-155`). The normalization funnel is:

```text
src/core/session.ail:695:func ported_provider(rt: ExtRuntime, history: [Message], provider: StepProvider) -> Ports {
src/core/session.ail:697:    Ported(p) => p,
src/core/session.ail:698:    LiveAI => live_ports(rt),
src/core/session.ail:699:    Scripted(script) => scripted_ports_from_steps(history, script)
```

All six public-entry uses do pass through it, as the correction assumes:

```text
$ rg -n 'ported_provider\(' src/core/session.ail
695:func ported_provider(...)
2015:  ... ported_provider(rt, history, provider))
2051:  ... ported_provider(rt, history, provider))
2114:  ... ported_provider(rt, messages, provider))
2137:  ... ported_provider(rt, history, provider))
2267:  let live_provider = ported_provider(rt, history, provider);
2295:  let live_provider = ported_provider(rt, initial_messages, provider);
```

That funnel makes the change mechanically applicable at all six sites, but its return type cannot
supply the newly required initial value. The scratch probe confirmed that an identity transition for
a stateless live adapter compiles; the gap is specification, not language capability.

**Action:** Specify that normalization returns `{ports, initial_provider_state}` (or an equivalent
pair), that live/stateless adapters return their input state unchanged, and whether `Ported` carries
caller-supplied initial state or is deliberately restricted to the stateless identity contract. The
pair's state is then installed once in `C2LoopState` and only successors replace it.

### R4. D5 obligation 2 still does not define the detector's classification set or close its package-root boundary

**Defect:** “Ambient-effect imports” has no enumerated, versioned meaning, so obligation 2 cannot
determine which import targets and symbols are candidates, how aliases are resolved, or what happens
when an installed AILANG dependency lives outside the fixed `src` + `packages` roots.

**Grounding:** in the normative body the phrase occurs only at ADR:855-856; the only nearby
enumeration is the profile's *forbidden* capabilities at ADR:782, not the detector input. The pinned
toolchain exposes more than the illustrative module list and the module/effect relationship is not
one-to-one:

```text
$ ailang builtins list --by-effect | rg '^# '
# AI (13)
# Clock (5)
# Cog (1)
# DOM (5)
# Debug (2)
# Env (3)
# FS (33)
# IO (6)
# Msg (5)
# Net (2)
# Process (4)
# Pure (209)
# Rand (5)
# Secret (1)
# SharedIndex (7)
# SharedMem (5)
# Stream (14)
# Trace (4)
```

`ailang.toml:53-54` permits a different twelve-label maximum, so that list alone is not a stable
module/symbol classifier. Module aliases are legal on the pin; a clean probe using
`import std/clock as c` and `c.now()` produced:

```text
$ ailang check alias_module.ail
→ Type checking alias_module.ail...
→ Effect checking...

✓ No errors found!
```

Matching imported target modules would handle that form; matching only bound call names would not.
For local wrappers and `ExtPorts` closures, scanning the defining module does see the literal ambient
site, so that part of the stated boundary is sound. The unresolved root case is concrete:
`ailang.toml:9` declares `sunholo/logging` from the registry and `ailang.lock:14-16` records
`source: "registry"`; its AILANG source is in neither normative scan root. It is used only by an
out-of-profile example today (`src/examples/test_logging/test_logging.ail:3`), but obligation 2 does
not say that a future profile must reject or scan such a dependency.

**Action:** Define and version the classifier from the pinned toolchain's effect-bearing stdlib/
builtin surface (module plus exported symbol), record it with each profile or manifest, match import
targets so qualified aliases are covered, and require re-derivation on every toolchain repin. Expand
the roots through the resolved lock graph for installed AILANG packages, or fail profile validation
closed when an installed package's source is outside the scanned roots. Keep manual triage and the
separate executed-path capability backstop; neither repairs an undefined classifier.

### R5. The installation-scoped “profile-reachable” definition contradicts two D4 classifications and does not define its hook use

**Defect:** the new definition covers reads in driver or installed-extension modules, but D4 assigns
`test_dummy` reachability to hook identity inside an always-present core module, retains an
execution-path conjunct for `compose`, and later applies the term to hooks rather than reads.

**Grounding:** ADR:751-759 defines only a *read* and explicitly rejects execution-path reachability.
Against that definition:

- `src/core/ext/runtime.ail:187-198` contains the `now()` site and the `is_test_dummy` guard in core;
  the module itself is not installed by a profile. Its five call sites execute the read only under the
  installed hook id (`:206`, `:222`, `:239-246`, `:280-287`, `:368-375`). ADR:678 nevertheless says
  the site is reachable when the hook is installed.
- ADR:679 says `compose` is reachable when it is installed **and the model calls `Compose`**, which
  is the path-sensitive meaning ADR:755-756 rejects. It is also factually too narrow as execution
  reachability: the installed extension's response-intercept path can call `now()` at
  `packages/motoko-ext-compose/compose.ail:756-771` without a `Compose` tool call.
- ADR:1190 requires every “profile-reachable hook” to be mediated, but the definition's subject is
  only reads, leaving the hook classification implicit.

Installation scoping itself is a sound conservative choice: it is enumerable, aligns with D5's
decision not to require reachability analysis, and makes conformance harder rather than easier. The
defect is the scope boundary and inconsistent applications. The arithmetic is correct only with the
missing qualifier: a checked-in profile with `compose` and without `test_dummy` has `4 + 8 = 12`;
a profile installing both has 13.

**Action:** Generalize the definition to effect sites and hooks, and include core sites guarded solely
by an installed hook's identity. Make every table condition installation-only: remove “and the model
calls `Compose`,” retain `test_dummy` under the new guarded-core clause, and say “a profile installing
`compose` but not `test_dummy` has twelve.” State that “profile-reachable hook” means every hook
installed by the profile, whether or not the corpus invokes it.

### R6. The re-corrected deferred source-comment range still leaves one stale line

**Defect:** the note prescribes deleting `stub_step.ail:171-172` only, but `:173` still describes the
removed `dispatch_step` parameter and is stale under the same source change.

**Grounding:** the three consecutive lines are:

```text
171 -- Returns both the step result and the updated provider (tail of script for Scripted).
172 -- Loop callers thread next_provider into their recursive call.
173 -- rt is forwarded to tools_with_extensions so extension tools appear in the LLM catalog.
```

The live signature at `src/core/test/stub_step.ail:192-199` accepts `ports`, `model`, `msgs`, and
`on_chunk` only. `rt` is instead captured by `live_ports(rt)` and used in its closure at `:148-154`.
The note is right that `:170` remains accurate and that `:190-191` correctly describe the current
one-arm function.

**Action:** Change the deferred source-fix instruction to delete `171-173`, preserving `:170` and
`:189`; re-ground the Context row when that source-only cleanup lands.

## What is accurate

All statements here were re-run against the correction target's unchanged source, rather than
inherited from any prior review.

**A1 — is the bidirectional widening buildable as specified? No; the core shape is buildable, but
the real integration is not yet specified.** A closure can accept state it did not capture, and an
immutable recursive record can replace the single successor field without a second home: the clean
three-module v0.26.0 probe passed. The six `ported_provider` users share a usable normalization
funnel. R1-R3 are the missing pieces: the extension-provider round trip, the concrete lower-layer
state type, and live/`Ported` initialization and identity semantics. This does not overturn D1's
state-threading decision; it bounds the additional contract and ABI work required to implement it.

**A2 — is D5 obligation 2 specified well enough to build? No.** The correction accurately withdraws
the preceding call-graph diagnosis. `source_parser.py:164-173` binds bare imports and `:193-196`
resolves their direct std calls; executing the parser on `src/core/session.ail` returned the four
`std/clock#now` rows for `derive_session_id`, `emit_run_summary`, and both run entry helpers. The
source-parser test suite also passed:

```text
$ python3 -m pytest -q tools/code-graph/tests/test_source_parser.py
...                                                                      [100%]
3 passed in 0.01s
```

The correction's scope and granularity disqualifiers are exact:
`PROFILES["core"] = ("src/core",)` at `config.py:13-17`; the plain-call path deduplicates at
`source_parser.py:248-261`; the interpolation path emits without that `seen` check at `:268-281`.
The proposed replacement still lacks the classifier and dependency-root rule in R4, so its
verification marker cannot be cleared.

**A3 — does “profile-reachable” hold across every use? No.** Installation scope is the correct
fail-closed trade and does not inherently make an existing configuration unachievable, but R5 shows
that it fails the `test_dummy` and `compose` rows and is read-specific while the acceptance table uses
it for hooks. “Every time-bearing read reachable in the profile” at ADR:1192 is consistent once the
definition is repaired; “every profile-reachable hook” at ADR:1190 needs the explicit hook rule in
R5.

**A4 — configuration and clock arithmetic.** Re-enumerating every checked-in
`.motoko/config/*/config.json` confirmed that default's order is exactly the seven names stated at
ADR:683-686, `compose` occurs only in `.motoko/config/ailang/config.json`, and `test_dummy` occurs in
none. The executed counts were:

```text
compose-config-count=1
test-dummy-config-count=0
now-code-sites=13
clock-import-files=5
```

`parse_tokens` at `registry_generated.ail:51-65` iterates only configured tokens and constructs only
`Some(hook)` returned by `resolve`; there is no implicit installation. The 13 code sites re-count as
4 driver + 1 guarded `test_dummy` + 8 `compose`, none routed through `ExtPorts.clock_now`. Thus no
checked-in config realizes all 13, the default configuration has 4 installation-scoped sites, and
the checked-in `ailang` configuration has 12. Every per-row condition is correct after R5's
installation-only repair.

**A5 — anchors.** The requested anchors were printed with `nl -ba`. These are exact:
`registry_generated.ail:51-65` (`parse_tokens`), `scripted_ports.ail:38-48`
(`scripted_model_next`), `config.py:13-17` (`PROFILES`), `source_parser.py:176-199`
(`_resolve_call`), `ports.ail:18` (`model_step`), `stub_step.ail:88-96` (`play_chunks`), `:148-154`
(the live closure and constructor call), `:157-168` (`scripted_ports_from_steps`), and `:192-199`
(`dispatch_step`). `agents_md.ail:106` is the effect-row-free `walk_agents` declaration and its
`fileExists` operations are at `:109` and `:116`; clean-cache checks of both
`src/core/session.ail` and `src/core/agents_md.ail` completed with “No errors found,” confirming that
v0.26.0 accepts the under-declaration. The stale
note's `171-172` and `190-191` ranges are correctly re-anchored but its requested edit is incomplete
because of R6; the prior ranges would indeed have removed correct `:170` and retained stale `:172`.

**A6 — Status.** At the reviewed target, the two blocker kinds are coherent: unshipped external API
versus unverified internal correction text. “Both sets are now corrected” describes authoring state;
“neither the correction set nor acceptance state ... complete” correctly withholds verification and
acceptance, so those sentences do not contradict. The seven historical sections support the settled
list: the three F1-F6 verifications each rule on F1/F2/F3/F5/F6, the narrowed clause, upstream shape,
and M2; only the Codex and Kimi sections explicitly certify the zero-`RunSummary` claim. Both delta
reviews rederive 13/unrouted and confirm C3/C4/C5/C9/C14. D6.1 is therefore correctly stated as two
of three, not three.

**A7 — collateral consistency.** D4:652-655 now defers to D5's textual site inventory without
asserting a call-graph bias. D5's hermeticity bullet at `:826-831` derives clock scope from installed
extensions, and obligation 2 states site inventory rather than reachability; aside from R4 and R5,
the three statements agree. The 007 pillar mapping at ADR:1173 says only “capability/routing audits”
and remains accurate. The virtual-time acceptance row at ADR:1192 requires the same completeness
audit that D5 marks non-citable until verification, so it does not silently treat the gate as passed.

**Upstream blocker.** The public upstream issue
[`sunholo-data/ailang#546`](https://github.com/sunholo-data/ailang/issues/546) was checked read-only
on 2026-08-01: it remains Open, has no linked development, records zero
`stepWithStreamRecorded` symbols in the v0.31.0 release, and describes the working implementation as
the author's fork diff. That is prototype evidence only. Nothing in this correction range lands an
upstream release or repins this repo; `ailang.toml:6` and `ailang.lock:2-4` remain v0.26.0.

## Recommended pre-acceptance actions

**This ADR must fix, in dependency order:**

1. Resolve **R1** first: decide whether the interim provider token traverses extension AI calls and
   budget the resulting `ExtPorts`/hook ABI changes, or explicitly narrow the interim fix and profile.
   This determines whether handoff item 2 truly precedes or partly joins the ABI-major milestone.
2. With that boundary fixed, resolve **R2-R3**: name the concrete lower-layer state, initialization
   pair, live identity transition, and `Ported` contract. Keep one persistent copy in `C2LoopState`.
3. Resolve **R4**: define the versioned ambient classifier, alias rule, lock-graph/root policy, and
   repin invalidation rule before removing D5's non-citability marker.
4. Resolve **R5**: make installation scope cover installed hooks and hook-guarded core sites, and
   reconcile the table and 4/12/13 wording.
5. Resolve **R6**: correct the deferred cleanup range to `171-173`.

**The implementation plan, not this ADR, owns:**

- the actual state/helper relocation, `Ports`/`StepProvider` constructor edits, all immutable
  `C2LoopState` successor copies, and any extension-ABI migration selected by R1;
- building and pinning the site-level inventory, resolving package sources from the lock graph,
  effect-row reconciliation, diffable output, and fail-closed manual-triage workflow;
- routing the selected profile's 4, 12, or 13 clock sites and exercising `ExtPorts.clock_now`, which
  still has zero call sites; and
- performing the source-comment cleanup and re-grounding anchors in the same source change.

## Accept / revise recommendation

**Revise — R1-R5 leave the two new mechanisms under-specified and R6 leaves an unsafe deferred edit;
the upstream API blocker remains fully in force, is not cleared by the fork prototype or this review,
and will still block acceptance after these ADR fixes until the recorded-stream API ships in a
release, this repository repins to that release, and the positive integration probe passes.**

in this tree could contribute a phantom result._

### R1. D1's new exclusion has no detector — nothing in the ADR derives which hooks to exclude, and obligation 2's one enumerated classifier is blind to `ExtPorts` field calls by construction

**Defect:** D1 excludes extension-issued model calls from every conformant profile, but D5's exclusion
machinery is per-*hook* while `ai_step` is a *port field*, and the only classifier the ADR enumerates
cannot see a call to it — so no gate step forces a profile author to exclude anything.

**Grounding:**

- D5's machinery is per-hook and definitional (ADR:894-896): "An explicitly excluded hook is not
  covered, must be named in the result, and causes a fail-closed `HarnessFailure` if dispatch reaches
  it."
- `ai_step` is a field on `ExtCtx.ports`, not a hook (`packages/motoko-ext-abi/types.ail:62-67`).
- Obligation 2's classifier is "the pinned toolchain's effect-bearing stdlib/builtin surface …
  derived from `ailang builtins list --by-effect`" (ADR:979-982). `ai_step` is not in that surface:

$ ailang builtins list -json | python3 -c "import sys,json; d=json.load(sys.stdin)['builtins']; \
  print('rows:',len(d)); print('named ai_step:',[b for b in d if b['name']=='ai_step'])"
rows: 324
named ai_step: []
```

- ADR:1010 then declares closure-reached effects **covered**, attributing them to the defining site in
  core rather than the extension's call site — so a site-granularity scan of `packages/` sees nothing
  at `packages/motoko-ext-compaction-ai/compaction_ai.ail:106`.

Enforcement is *available* but unnamed. `compaction_ai` reaches the port through exactly one hook —
`register.ail:98,103-104` binds `on_pre_step` to `compact_with_ai`, which reaches
`summarize_with_ai_result` (`compaction_ai.ail:119-120`) → `summarize_attempt` (`:104-106`) — so D5's
per-hook exclusion can express it once someone knows to. And the detector is one grep:

```text
$ grep -rn "ports\.ai_step" packages src --include=*.ail
packages/motoko-ext-compaction-ai/compaction_ai.ail:106:  match ctx.ports.ai_step(model, prompt_msgs) {
packages/motoko_ext_conformance/fixtures/reject_fixtures.ail:90:  let summary = match ctx.ports.ai_step(ctx.model, msgs) {
```

**Failure scenario:** a plan author writes a profile definition installing `compaction_ai`, runs
obligation 2's inventory over `src` + `packages`, gets no candidate at `:106` (it is not a stdlib
call), consults the profile-validation bullet at ADR:929-930 which fails closed only on *unclassified*
extensions, classifies `compaction_ai` as covered, and ships a profile D1 says cannot exist. This is
the "checklist wearing a gate's clothes" defect the earlier round named, reproduced one layer down.

**Action:** Add a second, ABI-derived classifier alongside the stdlib one in obligation 2 — the
`ExtPorts` field set read from `packages/motoko-ext-abi/types.ail:62-67`, re-derived on the same repin
trigger — and require profile-definition validation to **fail closed when any installed package
textually references an `ExtPorts` field that does not yet carry the world token** (today: `ai_step`).
It is exactly parallel to the target-module rule at ADR:990-994, costs one grep, and turns D1's
sentence into a gate.

### R2. "Not conformance-eligible" contradicts D5's own machinery and the acceptance table, both of which permit a conformant profile to contain named, fail-closed excluded hooks

**Defect:** D1, *Consequences*, and Handoff item 2 all say a profile installing an `ai_step`-calling
extension is **not conformance-eligible**; D5 and the acceptance table say exclusion costs *coverage*,
not conformance — and the pass's whole sequencing conclusion rests on the stronger reading.

**Grounding:** the strong claim appears three times, all added by this pass — ADR:344-345 ("a profile
installing any extension that calls `ExtPorts.ai_step` is not conformance-eligible in the interim"),
ADR:1430, ADR:1477. Against it:

- ADR:887-888: "An extension may appear **as covered** in a conformant profile only when every hook
  reachable within that profile is either…" — the predicate governed is coverage, and the profile is
  already stipulated conformant.
- ADR:1316, the *Is the tested boundary honest?* acceptance row: "every profile-reachable hook is
  effect-free or world-mediated, **excluded hooks** and adapter/parser boundaries are listed, and
  dispatch to an exclusion fails closed." Listing excluded hooks is presented as evidence a profile
  *passes*, not as a disqualification.

**Failure scenario:** a plan author reads D5 and ADR:1316, installs `compaction_ai` with `on_pre_step`
named as an excluded hook and fail-closed dispatch, and declares a conformant `default` profile —
precisely the outcome ADR:350-351 and ADR:1432-1433 assume is impossible when they conclude "the first
conformant profile is a purpose-built narrow one rather than a shipped configuration."

**Action:** Pick one and state it once. Either (a) an installed `ai_step`-calling hook is *excluded and
named* — conformant but not covered — in which case "the first conformant profile is a purpose-built
narrow one" is false as written and must be restated as a *coverage* claim; or (b) an `ai_step`-reaching
hook is a **profile-definition rejection**, not a hook exclusion, in which case say so at ADR:894-896
and add the carve-out to ADR:1316. (b) is the reading D1 needs; it is not the reading D5 currently
supports.

### R3. Obligation 2's classifier is derivable at module granularity but not as "module plus exported symbol" — the command emits internal builtin names that appear nowhere in Motoko source, so a `(module, symbol)` classifier matches nothing

**Defect:** ADR:981 specifies the detection set "as **module plus exported symbol**, derived from
`ailang builtins list --by-effect`". That command emits the *internal* builtin symbol, never the
exported one, so the symbol half of the specified classifier is both underivable and, if built
literally, a silent fail-open on the obligation whose two prior revisions both failed open.

**Grounding:**

```text
$ ailang builtins list -json | python3 -c "import sys,json; d=json.load(sys.stdin)['builtins']; \
  eff=[b for b in d if not b['is_pure']]; print('effect-bearing rows:',len(eff)); \
  print('named now:',[b for b in d if b['name']=='now']); \
  print('non-underscore effect-bearing names:',sorted({b['name'] for b in eff}-{n for n in {b['name'] for b in eff} if n.startswith('_')}))"
effect-bearing rows: 115
named now: []
non-underscore effect-bearing names: []
```

Every effect-bearing builtin is `_`-prefixed (`_clock_now`, `_fs_readFile`, `_ai_step`). Motoko source
writes `now()` under `import std/clock (now)` (`src/core/session.ail:30,791`) — a name no row carries.

Two further precision points the same run settles:

- The eighteen labels include `Pure` (209 builtins). A gate treating all eighteen as effect-bearing
  flags every `std/list` import. The effect-bearing label count is seventeen.
- The module-less rows (`$builtin`, `core`) are **all** `Pure`; filtering on `is_pure == false` leaves
  21 modules, every one a real `std/*`. The handoff's worry that the surface is partly module-less does
  not survive — but only after `Pure` is dropped, and the ADR does not say to drop it.

**Failure scenario:** an implementer builds the classifier as `(module, exported symbol)` pairs from the
command, scans `src` + `packages` for `_clock_now`, gets zero hits, and certifies a clean routing
inventory over thirteen unrouted clock reads.

**Action:** Replace "as **module plus exported symbol**" with "as the set of effect-bearing target
modules, obtained by filtering `ailang builtins list -json` on `is_pure == false` and projecting
`module`", and note that the `name` field is the internal builtin symbol, not the exported wrapper —
which is *why* the matching rule two paragraphs later is target-module matching rather than name
matching. Also record that nothing re-derives it today:

```text
$ grep -rn "builtins list\|builtins --" Makefile .github scripts
(no output)
```

### R4. "Both checked-in configurations" is false — there are fourteen, all fourteen install `compaction_ai`, and D4 in this same document treats the set as larger

**Defect:** the follow-up commit `81b0a89` grounds a universal conclusion ("No checked-in configuration
is conformance-eligible") on a premise about two configurations, and mis-states the size of the
checked-in configuration set.

**Grounding:** three sites, all introduced by `81b0a89` — ADR:39 ("Both checked-in configurations
install `compaction_ai`"), ADR:349-350 ("appears in the extension order of **both** checked-in
configurations, `default` and `ailang`"), ADR:1431.

```text
$ python3 -c "
import json,glob
ps=sorted(glob.glob('.motoko/config/*/config.json'))
print('configs:',len(ps))
print('with compaction_ai:',sum('compaction_ai' in json.load(open(p)).get('extensions',{}).get('order',[]) for p in ps))"
configs: 14
with compaction_ai: 14
```

D4 knows better in the same file: ADR:763 ("`compose` appears only in
`.motoko/config/ailang/config.json`") and ADR:773 ("every checked-in configuration except
`.motoko/config/ailang`") both presuppose a set larger than two. Independently confirmed: `compose`
appears in exactly one config, `test_dummy` in none —

```text
$ grep -rl '"compose"' .motoko/config/*/config.json
.motoko/config/ailang/config.json
$ grep -rl "test_dummy" .motoko/config/
(no output)
```

The conclusion at ADR:350-351 is true and **stronger** than the ground given: fourteen of fourteen, not
two of two.

**Action:** At ADR:39, ADR:349-350, and ADR:1431 replace "both checked-in configurations" with "all
fourteen checked-in configurations", and drop the enumeration `default` and `ailang` — naming two of
fourteen is what made the premise look narrower than the conclusion.

### R5. The Status block claims the third-pass round spent zero findings on anchor questions; both third-pass reviews spent their R6 on one, and the ADR's own stale-comment note records it

**Defect:** ADR:57-60 offers a measured justification for dropping the edit table — "the round reviewing
the second pass spent six of its fifteen findings on provenance and anchor questions a diff answers
directly; the round reviewing the third pass, with a real two-commit diff, spent **none**." The second
half is false under the same categorization that produces the first.

**Grounding:** the second-pass count checks out — 7 + 8 = 15 findings, of which ADR:3693 (R4, the
`175-204` range), ADR:3722 (R5, "C7's two anchors are each off by one"), ADR:3774 (R7, the `88-99`
range), ADR:4048 (R5, the omitted edit account), ADR:4070 (R6, "still misstates two source ranges"), and
ADR:4098 (R7, "off by one") are provenance/anchor = six. But the third-pass round carries the same
category:

- ADR:4491 — `### R6. The re-corrected stale-comment note fixes two lines and leaves a third that is
  stale by the same test`
- ADR:4907 — `### R6. The re-corrected deferred source-comment range still leaves one stale line`

Two of twelve. The ADR itself records exactly this at ADR:103-106: "**This note has now been wrong
twice** … the second cited `171-172`, which would have left `:173`. Both were caught by review, neither
by the authoring side."

**Failure scenario:** the metric is load-bearing for a process decision (no edit table from here on).
Overstating it by rounding two down to zero is the same unearned-claim pattern the prior rounds
punished, and this section files three anchor findings against the fourth pass (R4, R7, R8).

**Action:** Either state "spent two of twelve, both on the same `stub_step.ail` comment range", or
narrow the category to *provenance* alone — under which the second round spent one of fifteen
(ADR:4048) and the third spent none — and say which is meant. Do not keep the current pairing.

### R6. The Status header still says "two independent delta reviews", twenty lines above a paragraph the fourth pass rewrote to distinguish four

**Defect:** ADR:5-6 reads "**three independent verifications of the F1–F6 revision** and **two
independent delta reviews of the correction pass** (all 2026-08-01, recorded below) complete". Four
delta reviews are recorded.

**Grounding:** ADR:3535 (Claude Code, second pass), ADR:3940 (Codex, second pass), ADR:4218 (Claude
Code, "**Eighth section**", third pass), ADR:4668 (Codex, "**Ninth** independent delta review of the
third correction pass"). The fourth pass rewrote ADR:28-30 to say "The two delta reviews of the
*second* pass … The two delta reviews of the *third* pass …" and left ADR:5-6 unchanged.

**Action:** "four independent delta reviews (two of the second correction pass, two of the third)".

### R7. The clause-3 paragraph says "six call sites"; there are five

**Defect:** ADR:844-845 grounds clause 3 on "six call sites all of the form
`if is_test_dummy(h.id) then emit_dummy_hook(...)`". Five exist.

**Grounding:**

```text
$ grep -rn "is_test_dummy" src packages scripts --include=*.ail
src/core/ext/runtime.ail:197:func is_test_dummy(hook_id: string) -> bool {
src/core/ext/runtime.ail:206:      let _ = if is_test_dummy(h.id) then emit_dummy_hook(...) else ();
src/core/ext/runtime.ail:222:      let _ = if is_test_dummy(h.id) then emit_dummy_hook(...) else ();
src/core/ext/runtime.ail:239:      let _ = if is_test_dummy(h.id) then {
src/core/ext/runtime.ail:280:  let _ = if is_test_dummy(h.id) then {
src/core/ext/runtime.ail:368:  let _ = if is_test_dummy(h.id) then {
```

Five guards; five `emit_dummy_hook` calls (`206`, `222`, `245`, `287`, `374`). The miscount is inherited
verbatim from the third-pass review at ADR:4426, which listed the same five entries
(`206, 222, 239/245, 280/287, 368/374`) and called them six — the correction pass copied the number
without recounting the list beside it.

**Action:** "five call sites". The substantive claim is unaffected and is confirmed below.

### R8. The compose response-intercept citation opens inside `on_tool_handle` — the very path the sentence says is not required

**Defect:** ADR:755-756 justifies dropping "and the model calls `Compose`" by noting "the
response-intercept path reads the clock without any `Compose` tool call
(`packages/motoko-ext-compose/compose.ail:756-771`)". Line 756 is the *tool-handle* hook.

**Grounding:** `packages/motoko-ext-compose/compose.ail:756` is
`export func on_tool_handle(ctx: ExtCtx, call: ToolCallEnvelope, ...)`, closing at `:759`;
`on_response_intercept` opens at `:761`; the clock read is `let name = "inline_${show(now())}"` at
`:767`.

**Failure scenario:** a reader checking the claim lands on `on_tool_handle` and concludes the citation
proves the opposite of what the sentence asserts. Given that this ADR has already burned three review
rounds on off-by-N ranges, the standard here is exact.

**Action:** cite `:761-771`, or just `:767`.

## What is accurate

Everything below was re-run at `81b0a89` on `AILANG v0.26.0`, not inherited.

**Anchors introduced or changed by this pass — all confirmed.** `src/core/session.ail:662`
(`p.model_step(provider_api_model(model, base_url), …)` inside `ext_ai_step`); `:654-666`
(`ext_ai_step`, signature to closing brace); `:668-677` (`ext_ports_of`, which wraps `ext_ai_step` as
`ExtPorts.ai_step` — the closing brace is `:678`, a one-line undershoot, not worth an action);
`:695-701` (`ported_provider`, returning bare `Ports` today); `packages/motoko-ext-abi/types.ail:63`
(`ai_step: (string, [Msg]) -> Result[string, string] ! {…}`);
`packages/motoko-ext-compaction-ai/compaction_ai.ail:106`; `packages/motoko-ext-compose/compose.ail:767`;
`src/core/test/scripted_ports.ail:20-24` and `:20-48`; `src/core/test/stub_step.ail:34` and `:192-199`
(with `:198` the sole `model_step` call *in `dispatch_step`*); `src/core/ext/runtime.ail:190`
(`kv("ts", jnum(intToFloat(now())))` inside `emit_dummy_hook`, `187-195`). "Four hook contexts" is
exact — `ext_ports_of` has call sites at `session.ail:1622, 1649, 1696, 1778`.

**The stale-comment note is correct on its third revision.** `171-173` is the right range and the new
`rt` justification holds:

```text
$ git show 89a1d67^:src/core/test/stub_step.ail | sed -n '180,186p'
export func dispatch_step(
  provider: StepProvider,
  model: string,
  msgs: [Message],
  rt: ExtRuntime,
  on_chunk: (StreamChunk) -> () ! {IO, Trace}
) -> { result: Result[StepResult, AIError], next_provider: StepProvider } ! {AI, IO, Trace} {
```

`rt` was a real parameter and `next_provider` a real return before `89a1d67`; neither is now
(`:192-199`). `:170` is accurate and must survive, `:189` is a bare `--`, `:190-191` are correct.
Deleting `171-173` leaves a well-formed block. Third time is right.

**Configuration facts (other than the count in R4).** `compose` in `.motoko/config/ailang` only;
`test_dummy` in no config; `compaction_ai` in all fourteen. D4's clock arithmetic survives clause 3
unchanged — driver 4 (`session.ail:791, 842, 1991, 2089`; `:785` is a comment), compose 8
(`compose.ail:362, 503, 597, 651, 681, 767`; `author_tools.ail:101`; `authoring/dispatcher.ail:217`),
`emit_dummy_hook` 1, total 13; 4 / 12 / 13 for the three installation cases, and no checked-in
configuration reaches 13.

**Clause 3 is decidable, and "solely" does not smuggle back path analysis.** All five guards are
literally `if is_test_dummy(h.id) then … else ()` with no second conjunct — no config flag, no
execution-path condition — so the predicate is answered by reading one `if` head. `is_test_dummy` and
`emit_dummy_hook` have zero uses outside `src/core/ext/runtime.ail`, so the clause captures no other
core site and misses none. A hypothetical path guarded by hook identity *and* a config flag would fail
"solely" and fall through unclassified; that is the conservative direction and no such site exists
today, but the ADR could say so in a clause. The acceptance-table row at ADR:1316 reads correctly under
the new hook sense: ADR:840 defines a profile-reachable hook as every hook the profile installs, which
is exactly the quantifier that row needs. Note the interaction with R2 — under D1's exclusion,
`compaction_ai.on_pre_step` becomes a profile-reachable hook that is neither effect-free nor
world-mediated, which is precisely why ADR:1316's "excluded hooks … are listed" clause must be
reconciled with D1's stronger claim.

**Non-anchor claims in D5 obligation 2's new text.** `ailang.toml:9` does declare
`"sunholo/logging" = "0.4.0"` from the registry, and its sole importer is
`src/examples/test_logging/test_logging.ail` — an out-of-profile example, so exposure today is nil, as
stated. The aliased-import claim is confirmed by execution: `import std/clock as c` followed by
`c.now()` typechecks and effect-checks clean, as does the bare form, so target-module matching is
required rather than optional.

### Ruling 1 — is the A1 exclusion the right disposition, and is it enforceable?

**Right disposition: yes, and axis 4 checks out exactly as the ADR argues.** D5's coverage criterion 2
(ADR:891-892) admits an effectful hook only when it is "effectful only through D1 world-mediated ports,
with origin tagged by extension id and explicit world state returned to the host". `ExtPorts.ai_step`
returns `Result[string, string]` (`types.ail:63`) and no world state, so an `ai_step`-calling hook
already fails D5's own test independently of D1 — the exclusion follows from the criterion rather than
excepting it. (The ADR's quotation at ADR:340-341 elides "with origin tagged by extension id and"
without an ellipsis; the substance is unaffected.) The alternative — pulling the ABI widening into the
interim milestone — is not too-conservative-to-reject: it collapses Handoff items 1, 2, and 3 into one
change, and the widening is not a field edit but `ExtPorts.ai_step` plus the hook result types plus the
core dispatch results, behind an ABI major that ADR:1417-1419 says forces "a coordinated re-release of
every extension package". Sequencing that ahead of a change testable entirely against `Scripted`
providers is strictly worse. Exclude.

**Enforceable: partially, and not as the ADR specifies it.** The *unit* works — `compaction_ai` reaches
the port through exactly one hook, so D5's per-hook machinery can name and fail-close it. What is
missing is the step that derives *which* hook, and the ADR's one enumerated classifier cannot see the
call (R1). And D1's "not conformance-eligible" is stronger than what D5 and ADR:1316 actually license
(R2). As it stands the exclusion is a statement with an available but unnamed enforcement path — one
grep and one validation clause from being a gate.

**Is the interim milestone still worth sequencing first? Yes — but the ADR's justification needs one
concrete addition.** The purpose-built narrow profile is constructible from packages already in the
tree: neither `empty_stop_guard` nor `progress_contract_guard` calls the port (they only *construct*
`noop_ai_step` for their own smoke fixtures — `empty_stop_guard.ail:52-53,70`,
`progress_contract_guard.ail:136-137,154`), and `grep -rn "ports\.ai_step"` finds no call in either. So
D5's "pure guards and deterministic fixture hooks may form the initial profile" (ADR:900-902) is not
aspirational here. But the ADR names no candidate, and "the first conformant profile is a purpose-built
narrow one" is currently an assertion a reader cannot check. Name one — even as an example — and the
sequencing argument stands on its own.

### Ruling 2 — is `ProviderState`'s home and shape buildable as specified? (A2)

**Home: yes, verified by execution.** A three-module probe mirroring the real graph — a ports-analogue
declaring `ScriptedStep` (relocated) and a concrete `ProviderState`, a stub-analogue above it declaring
`StepProvider` and `ported_provider` returning a `{ports, state}` pair, and a driver-analogue holding
one `provider_state` field in a `C2LoopState`-analogue and threading the successor — typechecks clean:

```text
$ ailang check mod/pdriver.ail
→ Type checking mod/pdriver.ail...
→ Effect checking...

✓ No errors found!
```

Built from scratch in `/tmp/.../a2probe`, outside the repository. The relocation drags in nothing: the
only non-primitive dependency of `ScriptedStep` is `ToolCall` from `std/ai`, and `src/core/ports.ail:9`
already imports `std/ai`. The ADR has **not** named an impossible home.

The cycle claim behind the relocation is also correct. `src/core/test/scripted_ports.ail` imports
`ports` (`:13`), `stub_step` (`:15`), **and** `session` (`:18`); `stub_step.ail:23` imports `ports`;
`session.ail:133,139` imports both. So `ports.ail` can import neither, and a cycle probe reproduces the
stated rejection:

```text
Error: dependency cycle: LDR002: dependency cycle detected: mod/a -> mod/b -> mod/a -> ...
```

The generic escape is closed as described — `type Ports[s] = { … }` is accepted as a declaration and its
instantiation fails (`type unification failed … cannot unify old record type with *types.TApp`), and
`grep -rnE "^\s*(export\s+)?type\s+\w+\[[a-z]" src packages --include=*.ail` returns nothing.

**Shape: an acceptable plan-level detail, not a repeat of R2.** Both candidate shapes are constructible
— my probe used the record form (`{ model_steps: [ScriptedStep] }`, empty state `{ model_steps: [] }`)
and it composes with the `ported_provider` pair without a match at each construction site; a sum works
too. The type *can* exist, which is what distinguished R2's failure. One genuine gap worth closing in
the ADR rather than the plan: the type is named `ProviderState` but specified as the model cursor only,
while the precedent it replaces (`ScriptedPortsState`, `scripted_ports.ail:20-24`) carries `approvals`
and `clock_values` as well. Say whether the approval and clock cursors ride along in the interim
widening or are separate later ones — otherwise the plan will guess, and guessing wrong reproduces the
same bidirectional widening a second time.

### Ruling 3 — is obligation 2's classifier derivable in a gate? (A4)

**Yes at module granularity; no at symbol granularity (R3).** The command exists on the pin, exits 0,
is byte-deterministic across runs (identical `md5sum` on two invocations), and carries a `-json` flag
emitting `{name, module, signature, is_pure, effect, num_args, description}` per builtin — better gate
infrastructure than the ADR claims. The disagreement it cites is real: eighteen labels from the builtin
surface (one of which is `Pure`) against twelve in `ailang.toml:54`
(`IO, Env, AI, Net, FS, Process, SharedMem, Clock, Stream, SharedIndex, Rand, Trace`), so neither alone
is a classifier — confirmed. Every effect-bearing row carries a real `std/*` module once `Pure` is
filtered, so the handoff's worry about a module-less surface does not survive, and target-module
matching covers the bare, aliased, and qualified forms as claimed. What is not derivable is the
"exported symbol" half, and building it literally yields a classifier that matches nothing. It is also
not wired into CI, the Makefile, or `scripts/` today, so "re-derived on every repin" is a process
obligation with no mechanism — acceptable only because the repin is itself a sequenced milestone.

## Recommended pre-acceptance actions

**This ADR must fix, in dependency order:**

1. **R2** — decide whether an installed `ai_step`-calling hook is an *excluded hook* (conformant,
   uncovered) or a *profile-definition rejection*. Everything below depends on which. R1's fix is only
   well-formed once this is settled, and R4's conclusion is phrased in whichever vocabulary this picks.
2. **R1** — add the `ExtPorts`-field classifier and the fail-closed validation clause, so the exclusion
   chosen in (1) has a detector rather than a paragraph.
3. **R3** — restate obligation 2's detection set as effect-bearing target modules derived by
   `is_pure == false` from `ailang builtins list -json`, drop "exported symbol", and name the `Pure`
   exclusion. Do this in the same edit as (2) so the two classifiers are specified side by side.
4. **R4** — correct "both checked-in configurations" to "all fourteen" at ADR:39, :349-350, :1431.
5. **R5, R6, R7, R8** — the four precision corrections. Independent of each other and of the above.

**Belongs to the implementation plan, not this ADR:**

- `ProviderState`'s concrete field shape (record vs sum) — either builds.
- Whether the approval and clock cursors ride along in the interim widening; the ADR should pose the
  question, the plan should answer it.
- Naming the first purpose-built narrow conformant profile, and confirming its extension set against
  the R1 detector once that detector exists.
- Building both classifiers and the `171-173` source deletion, in the same change that re-grounds this
  ADR's anchors into `src/core/test/stub_step.ail`.

## Accept / revise recommendation

**Revise — the fourth pass's substance holds (the extension-model-path exclusion is the right
disposition and follows from D5's own criterion, and `ProviderState`'s home is buildable exactly as
specified, both verified by execution), but R1 leaves that exclusion without a detector, R2 leaves D1
and D5 saying different things about what it costs, and R3 leaves the routing classifier fail-open if
built literally; the upstream API blocker is untouched by this pass and remains fully in force — it
still requires the recorded-stream API in an actual AILANG *release*, this repository repinned to that
release, and the positive integration probe passing, none of which the `v0.31.0` fork prototype
satisfies.**

**Residual risk if the five actions land as recommended:** the exclusion's detector is a textual grep
over installed packages and inherits obligation 2's stated soundness boundary — it will not see an
`ai_step` reached through an alias or a re-exported wrapper inside an extension, which nothing at HEAD
does and nothing prevents. The classifier's repin re-derivation still has no CI mechanism. And the
first conformant profile remains unnamed, so "purpose-built narrow one" is a claim the plan, not this
ADR, will have to make good.

## Review Comments

_Reviewer: Codex (model: `GPT-5`), 2026-08-01. Independent delta verification of the fourth
correction pass at `81b0a899c9338a63a6abfe08172ee6cb15d313ec`, covering
`abb059d..81b0a89` under pinned AILANG v0.26.0 (`3b52a24`). **Eleventh section:** `HEAD` contained
nine review sections, but the working tree already contained an uncommitted tenth section when this
review began; that section was preserved verbatim and this review was appended at the user's explicit
direction. Fresh typechecking probes ran outside the repository so its `.ailang` cache could not
affect the result._

### R1. The interim `ai_step` exclusion has no detector, so its universal profile rejection is not an enforceable gate

**Defect:** D1 rejects every profile installing an extension that calls `ExtPorts.ai_step`, but D5's
existing fail-closed mechanism acts only after a hook has already been classified as excluded, and
the sole specified source classifier cannot discover this port-field use.

**Grounding:** D5 says an explicitly excluded *hook* is named and fails closed if dispatch reaches it
(ADR:894-896), and profile validation fails closed only for an *unclassified* extension, hook, or
adapter (ADR:929-930). `ai_step` is instead a field of `ExtPorts`
(`packages/motoko-ext-abi/types.ail:62-67`). The complete direct-reference inventory was:

```text
$ rg -n "ctx\.ports\.ai_step|ports\.ai_step|\.ai_step\(" src packages --glob '*.ail'
packages/motoko-ext-compaction-ai/compaction_ai.ail:106:  match ctx.ports.ai_step(model, prompt_msgs) {
packages/motoko_ext_conformance/fixtures/reject_fixtures.ail:90:  let summary = match ctx.ports.ai_step(ctx.model, msgs) {
```

Obligation 2 derives only the toolchain's stdlib/builtin surface; that surface cannot classify an ABI
record-field call. For the live extension, the call is reachable through one known hook:
`packages/motoko-ext-compaction-ai/register.ail:103-105` installs `compact_with_ai` as
`on_pre_step`, which reaches `summarize_with_ai_result` and then the call at `compaction_ai.ail:106`.
Thus D5 can enforce a manually known exclusion, and omitting the entire extension is sufficient for a
specific narrow profile, but nothing in the ADR derives that classification for this or a future
extension.

**Action:** Add a second, ABI-port classifier to D5 obligation 2: enumerate the `ExtPorts` fields that
are not yet D1 world-mediated (today `ai_step`), inventory their field-reference sites across every
in-profile source root, and fail profile-definition validation closed when an installed hook or
extension reaches one. State the textual detector's alias/wrapper soundness boundary and require
manual fail-closed triage for unresolved references.

### R2. D1's “not conformance-eligible” rule contradicts D5's treatment of named excluded hooks

**Defect:** D1 says installing an `ai_step`-calling extension disqualifies the whole profile, whereas
D5 and the acceptance table permit a conformant profile to contain a named, uncovered hook whose
dispatch fails closed.

**Grounding:** the stronger rule appears at ADR:339-343, :1423-1433, and :1475-1478. D5 instead says
“An explicitly excluded hook is not covered, must be named in the result, and causes a fail-closed
`HarnessFailure` if dispatch reaches it” (ADR:894-896). The acceptance row at ADR:1316 likewise lists
excluded hooks plus fail-closed dispatch as passing evidence for an honest tested boundary. Under
that text, installing `compaction_ai` with `on_pre_step` classified as excluded costs coverage and
makes an attempted dispatch fail; it does not by itself make the profile non-conformant.

**Action:** Choose one contract and use it consistently. The sequencing argument is clearest if an
installed hook that can call a non-world-mediated `ai_step` is a **profile-definition rejection**
until the ABI major, rather than an ordinary D5 excluded hook; if that is the intended rule, add it to
D5 and its acceptance row. Otherwise replace the “not conformance-eligible” and “first conformant
profile” claims with coverage claims.

### R3. Obligation 2's exported-symbol classifier cannot be derived from the command it names

**Defect:** `ailang builtins list --by-effect` exposes internal builtin names, not exported AILANG
symbols, so the specified `(module, exported symbol)` classifier silently matches no source calls if
implemented literally.

**Grounding:** the machine-readable form exists and is stable, but its names are internal:

```text
$ ailang builtins list -json | jq '{effect_bearing_count: ([.builtins[] | select(.is_pure == false)] | length), source_now_names: [.builtins[] | select(.name == "now")], internal_clock_now: [.builtins[] | select(.name == "_clock_now")], effect_names_not_internal_count: ([.builtins[] | select(.is_pure == false and (.name | startswith("_") | not))] | length)}'
{
  "effect_bearing_count": 115,
  "source_now_names": [],
  "internal_clock_now": [{"name":"_clock_now","module":"std/clock", ...}],
  "effect_names_not_internal_count": 0
}
```

Source uses the exported wrapper name `now`, for example `src/core/session.ail:30,791`. All 115
effect-bearing rows do have real `std/*` modules; the only `$builtin`/`core` rows are pure. The label
count also needs a qualifier:

```text
$ ailang builtins list -json | jq '[.builtins[] | if .is_pure then "Pure" else .effect end] | unique'
["AI","Clock","Cog","DOM","Debug","Env","FS","IO","Msg","Net","Process","Pure","Rand","Secret","SharedIndex","SharedMem","Stream","Trace"]
$ sed -n 's/^max = \[\(.*\)\]/\1/p' ailang.toml | awk -F',' '{print NF}'
12
```

There are eighteen output groups **including `Pure`**, hence seventeen effect labels, versus twelve
permitted effects. Neither enumeration alone is a source classifier. Two consecutive JSON
invocations were byte-identical, `jq` parsed the documented fields, and no current gate consumes it:

```text
$ rg -n "builtins list|--by-effect|builtins.*-json" Makefile .github scripts --glob '*'
(no output)
```

**Action:** Define the conservative classifier as the target-module set obtained from
`ailang builtins list -json` by selecting `is_pure == false` and projecting `module`; scan every call
bound from those modules at site granularity and manually triage pure exports. Drop “exported symbol”
unless a separate stdlib-export mapping is specified, and say explicitly that `Pure` is filtered out.

### R4. Profile-reachable clause 3 is not gate-decidable as written, and its motivating count is wrong

**Defect:** “guarded solely by an installed hook's identity” is an unspecified control-path property,
not something the profile list plus module inventory decides, and the paragraph miscounts five guard
sites as six.

**Grounding:** the current motivating sites are direct and all fit an identity-only lexical guard, but
there are five:

```text
$ rg -n "is_test_dummy|emit_dummy_hook" src/core/ext/runtime.ail
197:func is_test_dummy(hook_id: string) -> bool {
206:      let _ = if is_test_dummy(h.id) then emit_dummy_hook(...) else ();
222:      let _ = if is_test_dummy(h.id) then emit_dummy_hook(...) else ();
239:      let _ = if is_test_dummy(h.id) then {
245:        emit_dummy_hook(...)
280:  let _ = if is_test_dummy(h.id) then {
287:    emit_dummy_hook(...)
368:  let _ = if is_test_dummy(h.id) then {
374:    emit_dummy_hook(...)
```

The ambient `now()` is inside the callee at `runtime.ail:190`, so even this case requires proving that
all callers are identity-guarded; it is not answered by a module inventory alone. A live mixed-guard
shape already exists at `src/core/tool_phase.ail:222-223`:
`is_scratchpad_tool_name(envelope.tool) && scratchpad_extension_active(rt)` guards the effectful
`exec_scratchpad_cell_ws` call. It can execute when `scratchpad` is installed but fails the word
“solely”; a future identity guard plus a config flag has the same problem. The acceptance-table phrase
“every profile-reachable hook” remains grammatically correct, but only after the underlying predicate
is made mechanical.

**Action:** Replace the semantic “solely” test with an explicit, versioned site-to-hook attribution
in the profile/routing inventory; un-attributed core effect sites fail closed as unconditional core
sites. Additional guards must not remove a site from the installed hook's scope. Correct “six” to
“five.”

### R5. The follow-up's “both checked-in configurations” premise is false

**Defect:** The follow-up repeatedly says there are two checked-in configurations, but the repository
tracks fourteen and every one installs `compaction_ai`.

**Grounding:** the changed claims are at ADR:38-40, :345-352, and :1429-1433. The executed inventory
was:

```text
$ git ls-files '.motoko/config/*/config.json' | wc -l
14
$ for f in $(git ls-files '.motoko/config/*/config.json'); do jq -e '.extensions.order | index("compaction_ai") != null' "$f" >/dev/null && printf '%s\n' "$f"; done | wc -l
14
```

`compose` occurs only in `.motoko/config/ailang/config.json`, while `test_dummy` occurs in none. The
universal conclusion “No checked-in configuration” is therefore supported more strongly than stated,
but “both” and the enumeration of only `default` and `ailang` are false.

**Action:** Replace all three “both checked-in configurations” claims with “all fourteen checked-in
configurations” and avoid presenting `default` and `ailang` as an exhaustive list.

### R6. The Status opening still records two delta reviews when the ADR contains four

**Defect:** The Status header's review count and “both sets” summary were not updated for the two
third-pass delta reviews that the fourth pass answers.

**Grounding:** ADR:4-8 says “two independent delta reviews of the correction pass.” The historical
sections begin at ADR:3533 and :3938 for the second pass, and :4216 and :4666 for the third pass — four
delta reviews in two rounds. The newly rewritten ADR:28-31 itself distinguishes both rounds.

**Action:** State “four independent delta reviews (two of the second correction pass and two of the
third)” and revise the defect-set count so the opening agrees with the historical record and the body.

### R7. The Status block's claimed zero anchor/provenance findings in the third-pass round is false

**Defect:** The process justification says the two third-pass reviews spent no findings on anchors,
but both reviews' R6 corrected the same stale source range.

**Grounding:** ADR:57-60 says the third-pass round “spent **none**.” The two historical findings are:

```text
ADR:4491  ### R6. The re-corrected stale-comment note fixes two lines and leaves a third that is stale by the same test
ADR:4907  ### R6. The re-corrected deferred source-comment range still leaves one stale line
```

The second-pass arithmetic is six of fifteen; the third-pass arithmetic is two of twelve, both about
the `stub_step.ail` comment anchor. ADR:103-106 independently acknowledges that both were caught by
review.

**Action:** Replace “none” with “two of twelve, both on the same deferred source-comment range,” or
narrow the comparison to provenance alone and recompute both sides consistently.

### R8. The response-intercept anchor begins in the tool-handle hook

**Defect:** The range cited to prove a response-intercept clock read without a `Compose` tool call
starts at `on_tool_handle`, the path the sentence is distinguishing it from.

**Grounding:** `packages/motoko-ext-compose/compose.ail:756` opens `on_tool_handle` and it closes at
`:759`; `on_response_intercept` opens at `:761`, and its direct clock read is at `:767`. The ADR cites
`:756-771` at ADR:756.

**Action:** Change that citation to `packages/motoko-ext-compose/compose.ail:761-771` or simply `:767`.

## What is accurate

Everything below was re-run at commit `81b0a899c9338a63a6abfe08172ee6cb15d313ec` under AILANG
v0.26.0 rather than inherited from an earlier review.

**A1 ruling — the exclusion is the right sequencing disposition, but is not enforceable as
specified.** `ExtPorts.ai_step` returns only `Result[string, string]` (`types.ail:63`), while
`PreStepDecision`, `ToolHandleDecision`, `ResponseInterceptDecision`, and `FinalizeDecision` carry no
successor token (`types.ail:118-164`). D5 criterion 2 requires explicit world state returned to the
host (ADR:887-892), and D5 separately rejects hidden mutation behind decision-only hooks
(ADR:905-909). Thus an `ai_step`-calling hook is not world-mediated under D5 today; the exclusion
follows D5 rather than creating an exception. Pulling the hook/ABI widening into the interim milestone
would join item 2 to the ABI major and the repin/re-release sequence, delaying a main-loop cursor fix
that is independently testable now. Excluding that path is the better disposition. For a known
profile, omitting the whole extension is sufficient; the missing universal detector and the conflict
between profile rejection and hook exclusion are R1-R2.

The interim milestone remains worth sequencing first. No shipped configuration is eligible under the
strong D1 interpretation because all fourteen install `compaction_ai`, but a purpose-built narrow
profile is constructible: the installed `empty_stop_guard` and `progress_contract_guard` hook
decisions are pure functions (`empty_stop_guard.ail:8-40`,
`progress_contract_guard.ail:8-120`), and neither calls `ctx.ports.ai_step`. Their `noop_ai_step`
functions occur only in local test-context construction, not installed hook execution. This supports
D5's statement that pure guards and deterministic fixture hooks may form the initial profile, though
the implementation plan must name and validate the actual profile.

**A2 ruling — `ProviderState`'s home and required shape are buildable as specified.** `ScriptedStep`
depends only on primitive fields plus `ToolCall` from `std/ai` (`stub_step.ail:34-41`); `ports.ail`
already imports `std/ai`, so relocating the type there does not import a consumer of `ports` or create
the cycle it is meant to avoid. A fresh three-module probe declared `ScriptedStep` and
`ProviderState = { model_steps: [ScriptedStep] }` in the ports analogue, returned
`{ports, state}` from a stub analogue for `LiveAI | Scripted | Ported`, and threaded the successor
through one driver-state field:

```text
$ cd /tmp/adr001_codex_a2_probe && ailang check mod/pdriver.ail
→ Type checking mod/pdriver.ail...
→ Effect checking...

✓ No errors found!
```

The record makes live/`Ported` emptiness `{model_steps: []}`, scripted initialization
`{model_steps: script}`, and the identity successor for stateless adapters explicit. A sum type could
also express it. Choosing record versus sum is an acceptable implementation-plan detail because D1
specifies the observable initialization and transition contracts and at least one concrete lower-layer
shape composes; this is not another “specified where it cannot exist” defect.

**A3 current-source ruling.** All five `emit_dummy_hook` calls are guarded directly by
`is_test_dummy(h.id)`, and `is_test_dummy`/`emit_dummy_hook` have no other uses. No checked-in config
installs `test_dummy`. The clause correctly motivates attributing `runtime.ail:190` to that hook, but
R4 is required to turn the attribution into a stable gate rule.

**A4 ruling — obligation 2 is derivable in a gate only after the R3 correction.** The command exists
on the pin, exits zero, has a documented JSON mode, produced byte-identical JSON in two consecutive
runs, and every non-pure row has a `std/*` module. The module-less builtin concern does not survive
execution. The three accepted import forms all typechecked in fresh scratch modules:

```text
import std/clock (now)          → now()
import std/clock as c           → c.now()
import std/clock as c (now)     → c.now()

$ ailang check mod/bare.ail; ailang check mod/aliased.ail; ailang check mod/qualified_selective.ail
✓ No errors found!
✓ No errors found!
✓ No errors found!
```

Target-module matching therefore covers bare, aliased, and qualified forms by construction. The
classifier is not wired into CI today, which is acceptable for an unimplemented gate only if the ADR
specifies the derivation precisely and the implementation plan wires repin re-derivation before the
non-citability marker is removed.

**A5 anchors.** Confirmed: `src/core/session.ail:654-666` is `ext_ai_step`, with the second
`model_step` call at `:662`; `:668-677` constructs the `ExtPorts` record and binds `ai_step`; its four
call sites are `:1622,1649,1696,1778`; `:695-701` is the current bare-`Ports` `ported_provider`;
`packages/motoko-ext-abi/types.ail:63` is the state-less ABI; and
`packages/motoko-ext-compaction-ai/compaction_ai.ail:106` is the live extension call.
`src/core/test/scripted_ports.ail:20-24` is the three-queue precedent and `:38-48` the explicit
`result + next` model transition. `src/core/test/stub_step.ail:34-41` is `ScriptedStep`, and
`:192-199` is the one-arm `dispatch_step` whose `:198` is the sole seam call in that function.
`src/core/ext/runtime.ail:190` is the guarded dummy clock read. The compose clock read is exactly
`:767`, subject only to R8's over-broad range.

The known-stale-comment target is correct on its third revision. Current `stub_step.ail:171-173`
promises a successor provider and an `rt` parameter that no longer exist at `:192-199`; before
`89a1d67`, `dispatch_step` did take `rt` and return `next_provider`. Line `:170` remains accurate,
`:189` is a bare comment marker, and `:190-191` correctly describe the current function. Deleting
only `171-173` is exact.

**Configuration and D4 arithmetic.** All fourteen configurations install `compaction_ai`; only
`.motoko/config/ailang/config.json` installs `compose`; none installs `test_dummy`. The clock
inventory re-counts as four live `session.ail` reads (`791,842,1991,2089`), eight compose-package
reads (`compose.ail:362,503,597,651,681,767`, `author_tools.ail:101`,
`authoring/dispatcher.ail:217`), and one dummy-hook read (`runtime.ail:190`): 4 / 12 / 13 under the
three installation cases. Nothing is routed at HEAD, and no checked-in configuration realizes 13.

**Status and collateral, excluding R5-R8.** The settled F1/F2/F3/F5/F6, narrowed D1 blocker,
upstream return-shape, M2, D6.1, D4 count/routing, C3/C4/C5/C9/C14, and third-pass configuration,
anchor, and collateral rulings match the nine historical sections. D1, Consequences, and Handoff
item 2 consistently describe the main-loop cursor work as partial and place extension-world-token
widening in the ABI major. No remaining body text describes item 2 as a complete extension-path
cursor repair.

The upstream blocker is unchanged: the reviewed range neither ships a recorded-stream API in an
AILANG release nor repins this repository nor passes the required positive integration probe. The
`v0.31.0` fork prototype does not clear any of those conditions.

## Recommended pre-acceptance actions

**This ADR must fix, in dependency order:**

1. Resolve R2: define whether non-world-mediated `ai_step` use rejects the profile definition or is
   an ordinary excluded/uncovered hook. The fourth pass's sequencing argument indicates
   profile-definition rejection.
2. Resolve R1: specify the ABI-port-use detector and fail-closed validation that enforce the choice
   from step 1.
3. Resolve R3: derive obligation 2 from non-pure target modules in JSON, remove the underivable
   exported-symbol promise, and record the `Pure` filter.
4. Resolve R4: replace “solely” with a mechanical site-to-hook attribution rule and correct the guard
   count to five.
5. Apply the factual and record corrections in R5-R8: fourteen configurations, four delta reviews,
   two of twelve third-pass anchor findings, and the precise response-intercept range.

**Belongs to the implementation plan, not this ADR:**

- choose the concrete `ProviderState` representation and relocate/re-export `ScriptedStep`;
- build both source classifiers, wire them into CI and repin invalidation, and validate their alias,
  wrapper, and resolved-package-root boundaries;
- name and implement the first purpose-built narrow conformance profile, then run it through the
  profile validator; and
- delete `stub_step.ail:171-173` and re-ground this ADR's affected source anchors in that source
  change.

## Accept / revise recommendation

**Revise — the extension-model-path exclusion is the right sequencing choice and `ProviderState` is
buildable at the specified layer, but R1-R4 leave two required gates ambiguous or fail-open and
R5-R8 leave factual/history precision defects; the upstream API blocker remains fully in force and
still requires a recorded-stream API in a released AILANG version, a repository repin to that
release, and the positive integration probe passing.**

## Review Comments

_Reviewer: Claude Code (model: `claude-opus-5`), 2026-08-01. **Delta review of the fifth correction
pass**, per `HANDOFF-delta-review-fifth-correction-pass.md`. **Twelfth section**: two reviews
2026-07-26, three verifications of the F1–F6 revision 2026-08-01, four delta reviews of the second and
third correction passes, two of the fourth, this delta._

_Reviewed at `e8242f1570078337c203606b6ae5792108628876` (the fifth correction pass). The working tree
is `1d3f1c4d5ecc520645c0c336b656f62fdc3d894b`; `git diff e8242f1..HEAD` over this ADR is empty, so the
reviewed text is the text at HEAD. Target range `git diff b042757..e8242f1 --
.agent/projects/009_motoko_dst_execution/` — one commit, 146 insertions, 63 deletions, one file. The
untracked `mmd/` is out of scope. Toolchain `AILANG v0.26.0` (commit `3b52a24`), matching
`ailang.toml:6` and `scripts/install-prerequisites.sh:39`. Every probe below was built and run in a
scratch directory outside the repository, so no `.ailang` cache in this tree could contribute a
phantom result._

_The pass answers all eight findings of the tenth and eleventh sections. R2, R4, R5, R6, R7 of both

R8's replacement anchor is wrong (R8 here)._

### R1. Classifier 1 still fails open, for the third consecutive revision — the module set it derives cannot see effect-bearing stdlib modules whose effects come from AILANG source rather than builtins, and two of them are called in-tree, one from the core driver

**Defect:** ADR:1036-1038 defines classifier 1's detection set *by construction* — "obtained by
filtering `ailang builtins list -json` on `is_pure == false` and **projecting the `module` field**".
That projection yields 21 modules. `std/sem` and `std/extension` are not among them, yet both export
effectful functions that this repository imports and calls, including a `SharedMem` write reached from
`src/core`.

**Grounding:** the derivation, run on the pin:

```text
$ ailang builtins list -json > b.json && python3 -c "
import json; d=json.load(open('b.json'))['builtins']
c1=sorted({b['module'] for b in d if not b['is_pure']})
print('classifier 1 modules:',len(c1))
print('std/sem in set?','std/sem' in c1,'| std/sem rows:',[(b['name'],b['is_pure']) for b in d if b['module']=='std/sem'])
print('std/extension in set?','std/extension' in c1,'| std/extension rows:',len([b for b in d if b['module']=='std/extension']))"
classifier 1 modules: 21
std/sem in set? False | std/sem rows: [('_embedding_decode', True), ('_embedding_encode', True)]
std/extension in set? False | std/extension rows: 0
```

Both modules are effect-bearing in the pinned stdlib source, and the effects are the ones D5:949 names
as hermeticity failures:

```text
$ grep -n "export func \(store_frame\|load_frame\)" /home/motoko/.local/share/ailang/std/sem.ail
374:export func load_frame(key: string) -> Option[sem_frame] ! {SharedMem} {
385:export func store_frame(key: string, frame: sem_frame) -> unit ! {SharedMem} {
$ grep -n "export func.*! *{" /home/motoko/.local/share/ailang/std/extension.ail
27:export func requireWorkdirFile(workdir: string, rel: string) -> Result[(), string] ! {FS} =
```

`std/sem` carries a real runtime capability requirement, not just a declared row — a scratch probe
outside the repository:

```text
$ cd /tmp/.../c1probe && ailang run --entry main mod/main.ail
→ Type checking...
→ Effect checking...
✓ Running mod/main.ail
Error: execution failed: effect 'SharedMem' requires capability, but none provided
Hint: Run with --caps SharedMem
```

Both are live in-tree, and one is in the core driver, therefore profile-reachable under clause 1 in
*every* profile:

```text
$ grep -n "import std/sem\|store_frame\|load_frame" src/core/cache.ail
29:import std/sem    (make_frame_at, store_frame, load_frame)
60:  match load_frame(key) {
75:  store_frame(key, frame)
$ grep -rn "get_hint" src --include=*.ail | grep -v "^src/core/cache.ail"
src/core/rpc.ail:24:import src/core/cache   (get_hint)
src/core/rpc.ail:200:  let hint = get_hint(task);
$ grep -rn "^import std/extension" src packages --include=*.ail
packages/motoko-ext-omnigraph/register.ail:4:import std/extension (requireWorkdirFile)
```

Neither `std/sem` nor `std/extension` appears anywhere in this ADR (`grep -n "std/sem\|std/extension"`
returns nothing), so the hole is unacknowledged as well as unclosed.

**Failure scenario:** an implementer builds classifier 1 exactly as ADR:1036-1038 specifies, scans
`src` + `packages` for imports of the 21 derived modules, finds `src/core/rpc.ail:200` clean because
`std/sem` is not in the set, and certifies a complete routing inventory over an unrouted `SharedMem`
read-write pair in the core driver. D4's all-or-nothing rule then rests on a count that is not
complete, which is the exact defect the two previous revisions of this obligation were rewritten to
close.

**Why the prescription missed it:** both fourth-pass reviews checked that every `is_pure == false`
*row* carries a real `std/*` module — true, and confirmed again below — and inferred that the
projection is therefore total. It is not: the question is not whether the derived rows have modules,
it is whether every effect-bearing *module the repo imports* has a derived row. Ten of the twenty-one
`std/*` modules this repo imports have no effect-bearing row, and two of those ten export effectful
functions.

**Action:** the detection set cannot be the builtin projection alone. Either (a) union the builtin
projection with a scan of the pinned stdlib's own `.ail` sources for `export func … ! {…}` with a
non-empty row — derivable from `~/.local/share/ailang/std/*.ail` on the pin, same repin trigger, and
it recovers `std/sem` and `std/extension` mechanically; or (b) invert the classifier to a deny-list —
treat *every* imported `std/*` module as effect-bearing unless it appears in a derived
all-rows-pure allow-list, which fails closed by construction and is the direction the rest of
obligation 2 already argues for. State which, and record that the builtin surface alone is
insufficient and why, so a fourth revision does not rediscover it.

### R2. Classifier 2's stated criterion selects all four `ExtPorts` fields, not one — and applied literally it rejects the very remedy D5's clock gate mandates three bullets earlier

**Defect:** ADR:1054-1055 defines classifier 2 as "the fields of `ExtPorts` … **that do not yet return
world state** — today `ai_step`". None of the four fields returns world state. The parenthetical
"today `ai_step`" is the intended set; the criterion is not the criterion that produces it.

**Grounding:**

```text
$ sed -n '62,67p' packages/motoko-ext-abi/types.ail
export type ExtPorts = {
  ai_step: (string, [Msg]) -> Result[string, string] ! {AI, IO, Process, FS, Env, Net, SharedMem, Clock, Stream},
  proc_exec: (string, string) -> string ! {IO, Process, FS},
  clock_now: () -> int ! {Clock},
  env_get: (string, string) -> string ! {Env}
}
```

`Result[string, string]`, `string`, `int`, `string` — four non-world-mediated returns. The ADR's own
framing agrees that nothing is world-mediated yet: D5:956-960 requires "an explicit/opaque world token
… and return the successor token with the hook decision", which no field does.

**The contradiction this creates is load-bearing, not academic.** D5:974-977 makes routing *into*
`ExtPorts.clock_now` the condition of conformance for a clock-reading extension:

> a profile installing `compose` cannot claim conformance until its eight clock reads route through
> `ExtPorts.clock_now`

D5:980-982 then fails profile-definition validation closed "when an installed extension references a
non-world-mediated `ExtPorts` field from a hook the profile has not excluded". Under the stated
criterion `clock_now` is a non-world-mediated field, so a `compose` profile that does what :976-977
requires becomes a profile-definition rejection under :981-982. The prescribed remedy triggers the
prescribed rejection, six lines apart.

**"Retired field by field" is decorative under the narrow reading and unbudgeted under the wide one.**
If the set is `{ai_step}`, a one-element set does not retire field by field. If it is all four, the
world-token widening Consequences budgets (ADR:1505-1510: "`ExtPorts.ai_step`, the hook results that
carry its outcome, and the core dispatch results") covers only one of them, and the other three need
their own ABI majors that nothing schedules.

**Action:** state the criterion that actually selects `ai_step`, which is not "does not return world
state" but *"is the extension-side entry to a core seam that D1 requires to thread a cursor, and
cannot return it"* — `Ports.model_step`'s successor is the only cursor D1 currently demands, so
`ai_step` is the only member today. Then say explicitly that `clock_now`, `proc_exec`, and `env_get`
are **not** classifier-2 members in the interim and why, because D5:976-977 depends on `clock_now`
being a legal routing destination. If the intended set really is all four, say so and reconcile
:976-977, or the clock gate is unreachable.

### R3. "Every hook that can reach the port" is a call-graph property with no instrument, in the same document that just built one for the structurally identical core problem — and four sites state three different predicates

**Defect:** D1:365 makes the rejection turn on "excluding every hook that **can reach** the port".
Classifier 2 (ADR:1056) inventories "their **field-reference sites**" — textual, at site granularity.
Nothing maps a reference site to the hooks that can reach it. Clause 3 solved exactly this problem for
core, three hundred lines earlier, with a versioned site-to-hook attribution table; classifier 2 gets
no such instrument.

**Grounding:** the mapping the rule needs, re-derived rather than inherited, is four call-graph edges
across two modules with a self-recursive callee:

```text
$ grep -n "compact_with_ai\|summarize_with_ai_result\|summarize_attempt\|ports.ai_step" \
    packages/motoko-ext-compaction-ai/register.ail packages/motoko-ext-compaction-ai/compaction_ai.ail
register.ail:103:    on_pre_step: func(ctx: ExtCtx, msgs) -> PreStepDecision ! {...} {
register.ail:104:      compact_with_ai(ctx, msgs, compaction_cfg)
compaction_ai.ail:498:export func compact_with_ai(ctx: ExtCtx, msgs: [Msg], cfg: CompactionAiConfig) -> PreStepDecision ! {...}
compaction_ai.ail:484:    else match summarize_with_ai_result(ctx, summarization_prompt(...), cfg.model) {
compaction_ai.ail:515:          else match summarize_with_ai_result(ctx, update_summarization_prompt(...), cfg.model) {
compaction_ai.ail:119:export func summarize_with_ai_result(ctx: ExtCtx, prompt: string, model: string) -> Result[string, string] ! {...}
compaction_ai.ail:120:  summarize_attempt(ctx, prompt, model, summarizer_max_attempts())
compaction_ai.ail:104:func summarize_attempt(ctx: ExtCtx, prompt: string, model: string, attempts_left: int) -> Result[string, string] ! {...}
compaction_ai.ail:106:  match ctx.ports.ai_step(model, prompt_msgs) {
```

That is a manual walk. ADR:865-866 says of the identical shape in core: "Clause 3 is answered by an
explicit recorded artifact, **not by inspection**." Classifier 2 asks for inspection.

**The predicate also drifts across the four sites the split is asserted at**, which is what makes the
gap hard to see:

| Site | Predicate |
|---|---|
| D1:365 | hook that **can reach** the port (call-graph) |
| D5:941 | extension that **reaches a non-world-mediated seam** (call-graph, and *seam* is broader than `ExtPorts` field — `Ports.model_step` is a seam) |
| D5:981-982, ADR:1056-1058 | extension that **references** a non-world-mediated `ExtPorts` **field** (textual, site granularity) |
| Acceptance row ADR:1397 | extension **reaching** a non-world-mediated `ExtPorts` field from an un-excluded hook |

D5:941's "seam" is the widest and, read literally at HEAD where nothing is routed, would reject every
extension-installing profile. The textual "references" is the only one a detector can answer.

**Failure scenario:** a profile author greps for `ports.ai_step`, finds
`packages/motoko-ext-compaction-ai/compaction_ai.ail:106`, and must now decide *which hooks to
exclude*. With no attribution artifact the safe answer is "all of them" and the ADR's answer is
"`on_pre_step`" (ADR:373) — but nothing in the ADR licenses the narrower one, so two authors reading
the same text ship different profiles and only one of them is conservative.

**Action:** pick one predicate and give it the instrument clause 3 already has. The cheapest sound
rule needs no call-graph at all: **an installed extension with any classifier-2 field reference is
rejected unless every hook it registers is excluded.** That is decidable from a grep plus the
extension's `register.ail`, it is conservative, and it costs only the ability to keep one hook of a
referencing extension. If the narrower per-hook rule is wanted instead, extend clause 3's versioned
site-to-hook attribution table to cover extension packages and say that classifier 2 reads it —
which also gives the table a second consumer and makes R5 below cheaper to answer.

### R4. Implementation Handoff item 2 still says an `ai_step`-installing profile is non-conformant — the exact claim this pass overturned, in the third of the three sites both fourth-pass reviews named

**Defect:** the pass corrected D1 (:353-378) and Consequences (:1511-1516) but not Handoff item 2,
which still carries the overturned strong reading.

**Grounding:**

```text
$ awk 'NR>=1558 && NR<=1561' .agent/projects/009_motoko_dst_execution/ADR-001-deterministic-test-world-architecture.md
   **This item does not fix the extension model path**, and that is a decision, not an oversight:
   `ext_ai_step` reaches the same seam through an ABI that cannot return a successor (D1). It fixes
   the main loop, and profiles installing an `ai_step`-calling extension stay non-conformant until
   the world-token ABI lands.
```

Against ADR:353 ("That is a coverage cost, **not a conformance disqualification**") and ADR:939
("Exclusion is a coverage cost, not a conformance disqualification"). The tenth section's R2 named the
three sites as ADR:344-345, ADR:1430, ADR:1477; the eleventh named ADR:339-343, :1423-1433, :1475-1478.
Both included the Handoff item. Two of three were fixed.

**Failure scenario:** the Implementation Handoff is the section a plan author reads *first and often
only*. It tells them the interim milestone cannot produce a conformant profile from any shipped
configuration, which is the conclusion this pass exists to retract.

**Action:** at ADR:1560, replace "stay non-conformant until the world-token ABI lands" with "are
conformant only by excluding every hook that reaches the port — a coverage cost, and a
profile-definition rejection if they do not (D1, D5)". Then re-grep `non-conformant`,
`conformance-eligible`, and `disqualif` across the body before committing; the same grep is what would
have caught this one.

### R5. The site-to-hook attribution table is a required artifact with no producer, no validator, no schema, and no slot in the versioned profile definition it is named after

**Defect:** clause 3 now turns on "the profile's **versioned** site-to-hook attribution table"
(ADR:862-863) and gives it a fail-closed default (ADR:878-882). It gives it nothing else — and the
versioned profile definition that enumerates what a profile records does not list it.

**Grounding:** the profile-definition record, in full:

```text
$ awk 'NR>=910 && NR<=919' .agent/projects/009_motoko_dst_execution/ADR-001-deterministic-test-world-architecture.md
A versioned profile definition records:
- profile id/version;
- included extension ids and per-hook classifications (effect-free, world-mediated, or explicitly
  excluded);
- included and excluded provider/tool adapter and parser boundaries;
- logical resource models promised by the profile;
- permitted diagnostic projections;
- forbidden ambient effects/capabilities during execution; and
- every required D3 fault class the profile waives, each with the condition that waives it.
```

Seven bullets, none of them the attribution table. The execution manifest (ADR:921-923) lists source
revision, toolchain, package versions, ABI version, profile id/version, event-vocabulary version, and
normalized configuration — also not it. So the artifact clause 3 calls "the profile's versioned …
table" is versioned by nothing and stored nowhere.

**The contrast with D6 is the measure of the gap.** The event-vocabulary artifact (ADR:1207-1240) gets
enumerated contents, an explicit "this is new construction" ruling, a fail-closed validator at load, a
scheduling prohibition on dependent checks until it exists, a preferred derivable form that makes
drift a compile error, a manifest slot, and a version-change rule. The attribution table gets a name
and a default.

**Failure scenario:** the plan schedules the routing audit, discovers there is no table, and either
writes one by hand — reintroducing the hand-maintained-list rot ADR:1038-1041 rejects for classifier
1 — or falls back to clause 1 for every core effect site, which raises the driver's clock obligation
from four to five and makes D4's 4 / 12 / 13 arithmetic wrong.

**Action:** add the table to the ADR:910-919 record as an eighth bullet, and specify the three things
D6 got and this did not: **what makes an attribution correct** (a claim that the named hook's
installation is a necessary condition of the site executing — not that it is sufficient, per
ADR:880-882), **when it is validated** (at profile load, failing closed on a site not in the table and
not in core-unconditional), and **who produces it** (construction, in the same change that builds the
classifiers). Also state the D6-style scheduling prohibition: no D4 routing-completeness claim before
the table exists, because until then "four driver reads" is not derivable.

### R6. The Status header undercounts delta reviews for the second consecutive pass, and contradicts itself three lines later and again at line 29

**Defect:** ADR:6-7 now says "**four independent delta reviews (two of the second correction pass, two
of the third)** … recorded below". Six are recorded below at this commit. The pass applied both
fourth-pass R6 actions verbatim — correct at `81b0a89`, stale at `e8242f1`, because the two fourth-pass
reviews were themselves committed into the ADR at the baseline `b042757`.

**Grounding:**

```text
$ grep -n "^## Review Comments" .agent/projects/009_motoko_dst_execution/ADR-001-deterministic-test-world-architecture.md
1698 2158            <- two full reviews, 2026-07-26
2635 2950 3229       <- three F1-F6 verifications
3616 4021            <- two delta reviews, second correction pass
4299 4749            <- two delta reviews, third correction pass
5135 5590            <- two delta reviews, FOURTH correction pass (baseline b042757)
```

Six delta reviews, not four. Two further inconsistencies inside the same block:

- ADR:9 was not touched and still reads "**the two delta reviews** returned *Revise* and converged on
  another" — three lines under a corrected count of four. The eleventh section's R6 action asked for
  exactly this ("revise the defect-set count so the opening agrees"); the tenth's did not, and the
  pass followed the tenth.
- ADR:29-32 says "**The four delta reviews** additionally confirmed … and — **in the fourth-pass
  round**, by two independent three-module probes — that the … exclusion is the right disposition".
  It attributes to "the four" a ruling from a round the parenthetical at :6-7 excludes from the four.

**Action:** "six independent delta reviews (two each of the second, third, and fourth correction
passes)"; update ADR:9 to match; and drop "in the fourth-pass round" at :30 or keep it and let the
count include that round — one or the other, not both.

### R7. `compaction_ai` does not have one hook — it registers seven, and excluding only `on_pre_step` is not obviously sufficient under D5's own hermeticity clause

**Defect:** ADR:373 says excluding `compaction_ai`'s `on_pre_step` "disables the extension's **only**
hook". The extension registers seven hooks.

**Grounding:**

```text
$ awk 'NR>=99 && NR<=110' packages/motoko-ext-compaction-ai/register.ail
    provided_tools: [],
    on_describe_tools: \_ . [],
    on_build_system_prompt: \_ . { prepend: [], append: [] },
    on_budget_plan: \_ _ . { ... } ! {Env, FS},
    on_pre_step: func(ctx: ExtCtx, msgs) -> PreStepDecision ! {IO, Process, FS, AI, Env, Net, SharedMem, Clock, Stream} {
      compact_with_ai(ctx, msgs, compaction_cfg)
    },
    on_tool_policy: \_ _ . Allow,
    on_tool_handle: \_ _ . Delegate ! {IO, Process, FS, AI, Env, Net, SharedMem, Clock, Stream},
    on_response_intercept: \_ _ . NoIntercept ! {IO, Process, FS, AI, Env, Net, SharedMem, Clock, Stream},
    on_solver_candidate: \_ _ . NoDecision ! {IO, Process, FS, AI, Env, Net, SharedMem, Clock, Stream}
```

The **conclusion** survives — the other six are constant-returning lambdas, so excluding `on_pre_step`
does leave the extension inert on the compaction path, which is what the paragraph is arguing. The
stated fact does not.

**The secondary point is not cosmetic.** Three of the six trivial lambdas *declare*
`{IO, Process, FS, AI, Env, Net, SharedMem, Clock, Stream}` while performing nothing. D5:949 fails a
profile on "direct `AI`, `Process`, `Net`, `FS`, `SharedMem`, `Clock`, environment, or random effects
from a reached hook", and D5's per-hook classification (ADR:913-914) admits only effect-free,
world-mediated, or excluded. Whether a declared-but-unperformed row classifies as effect-free is
undecided here, and ADR:1104 concedes the reconciling detector "is not available today". Under the
declared-row reading, four hooks need exclusion, not one.

**Action:** "its only non-trivial hook, and the only one that reaches the port" at ADR:373. Separately,
state whether per-hook classification reads declared or performed effect rows in the interim — the
answer changes how many hooks a `compaction_ai` profile must exclude, and the successor detector that
would settle it is explicitly deferred.

### R8. The replacement compose anchor is wrong — `on_response_intercept` is `:761-790`, not `:761-771` — making this the fifth consecutive pass to ship an anchor error, in the edit whose only purpose was to fix an anchor

**Defect:** ADR:781 now reads "(`packages/motoko-ext-compose/compose.ail:767`, inside
`on_response_intercept` at `:761-771`)". The `:767` half is correct. The range asserts the function's
extent and is nineteen lines short.

**Grounding:**

```text
$ awk 'NR==761 || NR==771 || NR==790 || NR==792 {printf "%d: %s\n", NR, $0}' packages/motoko-ext-compose/compose.ail
761: export func on_response_intercept(ctx: ExtCtx, response_text: string, mode: string, snippet_caps: string) -> ResponseInterceptDecision ! {IO, Process, FS, Clock} {
771:       let _ = writeFile(path, "${compose_module_header(name)}\n\n${clean}");
790: }
792: func no_budget_patch() -> BudgetPatch {
```

`:771` is a `writeFile` in the middle of the inner `else` block; the function closes at `:790`. Both
fourth-pass reviews proposed "`:761-771` or simply `:767`" without stating the function's extent, and
the pass adopted the range *and* attached the words "`on_response_intercept` at" to it, converting a
loose citation into a false claim.

**A second, smaller instance in the same pass.** ADR:885-886 says `emit_dummy_hook` sits "behind five
call sites all of the form `if is_test_dummy(h.id) then emit_dummy_hook(...)` (`:206`, `:222`, `:245`,
`:287`, `:374`)". Three of those five lines are not of that form:

```text
$ grep -rn "is_test_dummy\|emit_dummy_hook" src/core/ext/runtime.ail
206:      let _ = if is_test_dummy(h.id) then emit_dummy_hook("on_build_system_prompt", ...) else ();
222:      let _ = if is_test_dummy(h.id) then emit_dummy_hook("on_budget_plan", ...) else ();
239:      let _ = if is_test_dummy(h.id) then {
245:        emit_dummy_hook("on_pre_step", "decision", tag)
280:  let _ = if is_test_dummy(h.id) then {
287:    emit_dummy_hook("on_tool_policy", "decision", tag)
368:  let _ = if is_test_dummy(h.id) then {
374:    emit_dummy_hook("on_solver_candidate", "decision", tag)
```

The guards are `206, 222, 239, 280, 368`; the calls are `206, 222, 245, 287, 374`. The count of five is
right and the tenth section stated both lists correctly; the pass merged them and cited the call lines
under the guard's syntactic form.

**Action:** `:761-790`, or drop the range and cite `:767` alone. At ADR:885-886, either cite the guard
lines with the guard form, or say "five `emit_dummy_hook` calls (`:206`, `:222`, `:245`, `:287`,
`:374`), each guarded by `if is_test_dummy(h.id)` (`:206`, `:222`, `:239`, `:280`, `:368`)". And
update ADR:68 — "anchor errors in four consecutive passes" is now five.

## What is accurate

Everything below was re-run at `e8242f1` on `AILANG v0.26.0`, not inherited from any prior section.

**Classifier 1's corrected label and module arithmetic — every number confirmed.**

```text
$ ailang builtins list -json | python3 -c "..."
total rows: 324 | effect-bearing rows: 115 | pure rows: 209
output groups (Pure + effects): 18
effect labels (is_pure==false): 17
modules from effect-bearing rows: 21, non-std/* among them: []
$ python3 -c "import re; ... ailang.toml max"
12 ['IO','Env','AI','Net','FS','Process','SharedMem','Clock','Stream','SharedIndex','Rand','Trace']
```

"Seventeen effect labels plus `Pure`" is exact; `[effects] max` is twelve at `ailang.toml:54`; the two
enumerations do disagree, so neither alone is a classifier. `Pure` is the largest group (209 of 324),
and projecting `module` over *all* rows would include `std/list`, `std/string`, `std/json` and the rest
of the pure surface — so "`Pure` must be filtered out explicitly" is a real and necessary instruction.
Every `is_pure == false` row does carry a real `std/*` module; there are no `$builtin`/`core` rows in
the effect-bearing set. The "module plus exported symbol" diagnosis is correct: the emitted `name` is
the internal builtin and no row carries `now`. **The correction the two fourth-pass reviews prescribed
was necessary and is faithfully applied. R1 is that it is not sufficient, which neither review tested.**

**D4's clock arithmetic survives the clause-3 rewrite unchanged.** Re-derived, not inherited:

```text
$ grep -rn "now()" src packages --include=*.ail
```

Thirteen live reads — `session.ail:791, 842, 1991, 2089` (`:785` is a comment), `ext/runtime.ail:190`,
`compose.ail:362, 503, 597, 651, 681, 767`, `author_tools.ail:101`, `authoring/dispatcher.ail:217`. The
four `noop_clock_now` *definitions* (`ctx_defaults.ail:15`, `progress_contract_guard.ail:144`,
`harness.ail:40`, `empty_stop_guard.ail:60`) match the grep on their names only and are not reads.
4 / 12 / 13 holds for the three installation cases, and clause 3's new form preserves it: attributing
`:190` to `test_dummy` keeps the driver obligation at four rather than five, which is what the table
needs. Nothing is routed at HEAD.

**Configuration facts.** Fourteen tracked `.motoko/config/*/config.json`, all fourteen with
`compaction_ai` in `extensions.order`, none without. The "all fourteen" correction is right at all
three sites (ADR:372, :1513, and the Status block).

**Anchors confirmed.** `packages/motoko-ext-abi/types.ail:62-67` is exactly the `ExtPorts` declaration
through its closing brace. `src/core/tool_phase.ail:222` is exactly
`if is_scratchpad_tool_name(envelope.tool) && scratchpad_extension_active(rt) then {`, and it is a real
live mixed guard over an effectful call at `:223` — the motivating counterexample is correctly stated.
`src/core/ext/runtime.ail:206, 222, 245, 287, 374` are the five `emit_dummy_hook` calls, and the count
of five is now right (subject to R8's form/line conflation).
`packages/motoko-ext-compaction-ai/compaction_ai.ail:106` is `match ctx.ports.ai_step(model,
prompt_msgs) {`. `packages/motoko-ext-compose/compose.ail:767` is the response-intercept clock read.
Only the `:761-771` range is wrong.

**The Status block's corrected metric — both numbers recounted independently, both right.** I
enumerated the `### R` headings in all four rounds rather than trusting the tenth section's arithmetic:

```text
second-pass round: 7 findings (ADR:3638-3857) + 8 (ADR:4032-4193) = 15
third-pass round:  6 findings (ADR:4329-4574) + 6 (ADR:4778-4990) = 12
```

*Anchor/provenance, second pass:* Claude R4 (`175-204`), R5 (two anchors off by one), R7 (`88-99`);
Codex R5 (omitted edit account), R6 (two source ranges), R7 (off by one) = **six of fifteen** ✓.
*Third pass:* Claude R6 (ADR:4574) and Codex R6 (ADR:4990), both on `stub_step.ail`'s deferred comment
range = **two of twelve, both on the same range** ✓. *Provenance alone:* Codex R5 is the only
second-pass member — Claude's R6 and Codex's R8 are about a handoff overstating a verification count,
which is a different category and defensibly excluded — and the third-pass round has none, so **one of
fifteen against none** ✓. The retraction is honest and the arithmetic behind it holds. This is the
one place the pass improved on its own inputs rather than transcribing them.

**Collateral that is clean.** D11 (ADR:1348-1374) carries class-reached and branch-reached counters and
no hook-coverage counter, so nothing there contradicts the split. The profile-definition record's
per-hook classifications — "effect-free, world-mediated, or **explicitly excluded**" (ADR:913-914) —
are exactly the three categories the split needs, and an un-excluded reaching hook is unclassifiable
under them, which is the right shape for a definition-time rejection. Consequences (ADR:1505-1516) is
correctly rewritten. The acceptance row (ADR:1397) is correctly rewritten in substance, though
"validation **rejected no** installed extension reaching…" is ambiguous between "found nothing to
reject" (intended) and "failed to reject" (the defect); "no installed extension … was rejected, and
none required rejection" would not be.

### Ruling 1 — is the coverage/rejection line in the right place, and does it have a detector? (A1)

**The line is in the right place, the timing argument is sound, and the detector does not exist.**

*Axis 1 — timing.* Sound, and I verified both halves against D5's machinery. An excluded hook that
dispatch reaches raises a fail-closed `HarnessFailure` (ADR:935-937), so it is a run-time-detectable
event and a coverage bookkeeping question. An un-excluded hook that reaches `ai_step` returns
`Result[string, string]` (`types.ail:63`) into a decision-only `PreStepDecision`, so the successor has
nowhere to go and the run completes normally with the cursor silently dropped — no failure, no counter,
no trace record. The two failures genuinely differ in detectability, and that asymmetry is the correct
reason to move one to definition time. **This is the pass's best work and neither review proposed it.**

*Axis 2 — "can reach".* It does reintroduce the trap. See R3: the predicate is a call-graph property,
classifier 2 is a textual site inventory, and clause 3 built the missing instrument for the identical
problem in core without extending it here. **Ruling: the same instrument should govern classifier 2**,
or the rule should be restated at extension granularity where a grep decides it. Nothing else in the
ADR closes this.

*Axis 3 — is "conformant and inert" worth having?* **Yes, and it is bookkeeping rather than
laundering — but the ADR should say one more sentence than it does.** The claim a conformant-and-inert
profile makes is narrow and true: *this* profile's world is honest about *its* boundary, and the paths
it does not test are named. That is exactly what D5's honesty criterion is for, and refusing the label
would mean a profile becomes non-conformant by installing something it then correctly excludes — which
punishes disclosure. The laundering risk is real but lives one level up, in what a *reader* does with
the word: ADR:377-378 already anticipates it ("must not be planned as though it delivers a conformant
*and covering* `default`"). What is missing is the acceptance-side consequence: D11 reports coverage
counters but nothing requires a profile to *have* non-zero hook coverage, so "conformant" is currently
satisfiable by a profile that excludes everything. **Add a floor** — a conformant profile must cover at
least one hook of every extension it installs, or must declare the extension itself excluded rather
than installed-and-fully-excluded. That closes the laundering path without weakening the split.

*Axis 4 — consistency.* Substantively consistent at all four sites; the *predicate* is not (R3's
table). D1:365, D5:941, D5:981-982, ADR:1056, and ADR:1397 use "can reach", "reaches a seam",
"references a field", and "reaching a field" for what must be one rule.

### Ruling 2 — is classifier 2's scope correctly bounded? (A2)

**No.** The set as defined by the ADR's own criterion is all four `ExtPorts` fields; the set the ADR
names is one; and the gap is not cosmetic because D5:976-977 makes `ExtPorts.clock_now` the mandatory
routing destination for the clock gate, which the criterion then rejects (R2). The handoff's framing —
"the ADR says the former and means the latter" — is exactly right, and the latter needs to be written
down. "Retired field by field" is decorative if the set is `{ai_step}` and unbudgeted if it is not.

Classifier 2's *soundness boundary by reference* to classifier 1's, however, does transfer correctly:
classifier 1's three stated limits (ADR:1080-1089) are out-of-tree effects, non-reachability, and roots
outside `src` + `packages`, and all three apply verbatim to an ABI-field scan. The alias/wrapper caveat
at ADR:1061-1063 is an honest addition and I confirmed nothing at HEAD aliases `ai_step` — the only two
reference sites are `compaction_ai.ail:106` and
`packages/motoko_ext_conformance/fixtures/reject_fixtures.ail:90`.

### Ruling 3 — is clause 3's attribution table an artifact or an intention? (A3)

**An intention.** It has a name, a versioning adjective, a fail-closed default, and a correct
semantics clause (ADR:880-882: attribution is necessity, not sufficiency — which is the right choice
and answers the mixed-guard problem properly). It has no producer, no validator, no schema, no storage
location, and no slot in the seven-bullet profile-definition record that is supposed to version it
(R5). Measured against D6's event-vocabulary artifact in the same document, it is missing five of the
six things that made D6 buildable.

*On the sub-question of whether failing closed into clause 1 is always conservative:* **for the routing
gate, yes** — clause 1 forces routing, and routing a site no run reaches costs work, not correctness.
I found no case at HEAD where it is the wrong answer rather than the expensive one. One boundary worth
recording: ADR:962-965 places host configuration discovery, package hydration, and child-process setup
*outside* the simulation boundary, so a core effect site that is genuinely pre-boundary would be forced
by clause 1 into a routing obligation the ADR elsewhere says it does not have. No such site exists
today — all four driver clock reads are already ruled in-scope by D4 — but the two rules have not been
reconciled and the table is where that reconciliation would live.

### What I could not clear

The upstream blocker is untouched by this pass and unchanged. The reviewed range ships no
recorded-stream API in an AILANG release, does not repin this repository, and passes no positive
integration probe. `arniwesth/ailang`'s `stepWithStreamRecorded` on the `v0.31.0` tag is a prototype
and satisfies none of D1's three conditions.

## Recommended pre-acceptance actions

**This ADR must fix, in dependency order:**

1. **R2** — restate classifier 2's criterion so it selects `ai_step` and not `clock_now`, and reconcile
   with D5:976-977. Everything about the split's detector is downstream of what the set *is*.
2. **R1** — close classifier 1's derivation. It is the more severe defect but is independent of (1),
   and the two belong in one edit so the classifiers stay specified side by side. Do not ship a third
   revision without checking the derived set against the repo's actual `std/*` imports; that check is
   two commands and is what the last two revisions both skipped.
3. **R3** — pick one predicate for the rejection rule and give it an instrument. If the extension-
   granularity rule is chosen, this closes without new machinery. If the per-hook rule is kept, it
   depends on (5).
4. **R4** — correct Handoff item 2, then re-grep the body for the overturned vocabulary.
5. **R5** — give the attribution table the D6 treatment: an eighth bullet at ADR:910-919, a load-time
   fail-closed validator, a correctness criterion, and a scheduling prohibition on D4
   routing-completeness claims until it exists.
6. **R6, R7, R8** — the three precision corrections, independent of each other and of the above.
   Recount the review sections at the commit being written, not at the commit being answered.

**Belongs to the implementation plan, not this ADR:**

- Building both classifiers and wiring their repin re-derivation; neither is in CI, the Makefile, or
  `scripts/` today.
- Producing the first attribution table, once the ADR says what one is.
- Naming the first purpose-built narrow conformant profile and validating it against the R3 detector.
  Still unnamed, as the tenth section flagged; `empty_stop_guard` and `progress_contract_guard` remain
  the obvious candidates.
- Whether per-hook classification reads declared or performed effect rows (R7's second half), and the
  `ProviderState` field shape and approval/clock cursor question the fourth-pass round deferred.
- The `stub_step.ail:171-173` deletion.

## Accept / revise recommendation

**Revise — the pass's central judgment is right and better than either review that prompted it: the
coverage-versus-rejection split is correctly placed, its timing argument is sound and verified against
D5's machinery, "conformant and inert" is honest bookkeeping rather than laundering, clause 3's
attribution semantics (necessity, not sufficiency) is the correct answer to the mixed-guard problem,
and the Status block's self-correction is the first metric in this document that survives an
independent recount. But R1 leaves classifier 1 fail-open on a live `SharedMem` site in the core
driver — the third consecutive revision of that obligation to fail open, and the first to do so on
evidence sitting in `src/core`; R2 leaves classifier 2's stated criterion rejecting the clock gate's
own mandated remedy; R3 leaves the rejection rule without the attribution instrument clause 3 just
built for the identical problem; and R4 leaves the overturned "non-conformant" claim standing in the
section a plan author reads first. The upstream API blocker is untouched by this pass and remains
fully in force — it still requires the recorded-stream API in an actual AILANG *release*, this
repository repinned to that release, and the positive integration probe passing; the `v0.31.0` fork
prototype satisfies none of the three.**

**Residual risk if the six actions land as recommended:** the classifiers remain textual and inherit
their stated soundness boundary — an `ai_step` reached through an alias or a re-exported wrapper is
still invisible, and nothing prevents one; the stdlib-source scan proposed in R1's action is itself a
textual derivation over a directory the toolchain owns, so a stdlib module whose effects arrive
through a mechanism neither builtins nor `export func … ! {…}` expresses would still be missed;
neither classifier has a CI mechanism, so "re-derived on every repin" remains a process obligation
carried by a milestone rather than a check; and the first conformant profile is still unnamed, so
"purpose-built narrow one" is a claim the plan, not this ADR, will have to make good.

target range itself is one commit, one changed file, 146 insertions and 63 deletions._

### R1. Classifier 1's corrected builtin projection is still fail-open because source-defined effectful stdlib modules need not have an impure builtin row

**Defect:** Filtering builtin rows on `is_pure == false` and projecting `module` omits at least
`std/sem` and `std/extension`, even though the pinned stdlib gives them concrete `Clock`, `SharedMem`,
`SharedIndex`, and `FS` operations used under the classifier's `src` + `packages` roots.

**Grounding:** exact commands and output from pinned AILANG v0.26.0:

```text
$ ailang builtins list -json | python3 -c 'import json,sys; d=json.load(sys.stdin)["builtins"]; ms={b["module"] for b in d if b["is_pure"] is False}; print("modules",len(ms)); print("std/sem in set", "std/sem" in ms, [(b["name"],b["is_pure"],b.get("effect")) for b in d if b["module"]=="std/sem"]); print("std/extension in set", "std/extension" in ms, [(b["name"],b["is_pure"],b.get("effect")) for b in d if b["module"]=="std/extension"])'
modules 21
std/sem in set False [('_embedding_decode', True, None), ('_embedding_encode', True, None)]
std/extension in set False []

$ rg -n 'export func (make_frame|load_frame|store_frame|requireWorkdirFile).*![[:space:]]*\{' /home/motoko/.local/share/ailang/std/sem.ail /home/motoko/.local/share/ailang/std/extension.ail
/home/motoko/.local/share/ailang/std/extension.ail:27:export func requireWorkdirFile(workdir: string, rel: string) -> Result[(), string] ! {FS} =

/home/motoko/.local/share/ailang/std/sem.ail:466:export func store_frame_ns(ns: namespace, frame: sem_frame) -> unit ! {SharedMem, SharedIndex} {
```

The omitted modules are used at `src/core/cache.ail:29,60,75`,
`packages/motoko-ext-context-mode/context_mode.ail:6,19,28,36,45`, and
`packages/motoko-ext-omnigraph/register.ail:4,26`.

**Action:** derive classifier 1 from the complete pinned stdlib interface/source surface as well as
the builtin registry, and treat an imported `std/*` module not proven effect-free as a fail-closed
candidate. Add a required comparison between the derived set and the repository's actual `std/*`
imports before the routing inventory may be cited.

### R2. Classifier 2's criterion selects all four `ExtPorts` fields while its asserted result names only `ai_step`, making D5's clock remedy reject itself

**Defect:** “Fields that do not yet return world state” describes `ai_step`, `proc_exec`, `clock_now`,
and `env_get`, not only `ai_step`; under that literal set, routing `compose` reads through
`ExtPorts.clock_now` as D5 requires triggers classifier 2's own profile-definition rejection.

**Grounding:** `packages/motoko-ext-abi/types.ail:62-67` is:

```text
export type ExtPorts = {
  ai_step: (string, [Msg]) -> Result[string, string] ! {AI, IO, Process, FS, Env, Net, SharedMem, Clock, Stream},
  proc_exec: (string, string) -> string ! {IO, Process, FS},
  clock_now: () -> int ! {Clock},
  env_get: (string, string) -> string ! {Env}
}
```

D5 requires a `compose` profile's reads to route through `ExtPorts.clock_now` at ADR:974-977, then
rejects un-excluded references to a non-world-mediated field at ADR:980-982. Classifier 2's
“retired field by field” text is also unsupported: the consequence scheduled at ADR:1505-1510 is one
ABI-major widening centered on `ai_step`, not four independently scheduled retirements.

The reference to classifier 1's soundness boundary is only partly transferable. Fixed scan roots and
the refusal to decide reachability apply to both scans; classifier 1's out-of-tree ambient-effect
limit is not by itself a boundary definition for an ABI-field matcher, which instead needs its own
alias, re-export, computed-field, and wrapper rules. ADR:1061-1063 names only part of that boundary.

**Action:** define the set by the property the ADR means: fields whose call loses successor state that
D1 requires the underlying core seam to return — today `ai_step`. Explicitly state why `proc_exec`,
`clock_now`, and `env_get` are not classifier-2 members under this interim rule; replace or precisely
explain “retired field by field”; and state classifier 2's own matching/soundness boundary.

### R3. The coverage-versus-rejection split has the right timing but no detector for its per-hook “can reach” predicate

**Defect:** Classifier 2 inventories textual field-reference sites, while D1 rejects a definition
unless every hook that *can reach* each site is excluded; no specified artifact or analysis maps an
extension reference site to its reaching hooks.

**Grounding:** the only live production `ctx.ports.ai_step` reference is
`packages/motoko-ext-compaction-ai/compaction_ai.ail:106`, but attributing it to `on_pre_step` requires
this manual chain:

```text
$ rg -n 'compact_with_ai|summarize_with_ai_result|summarize_attempt|ports\.ai_step' packages/motoko-ext-compaction-ai/register.ail packages/motoko-ext-compaction-ai/compaction_ai.ail
packages/motoko-ext-compaction-ai/register.ail:104:      compact_with_ai(ctx, msgs, compaction_cfg)
packages/motoko-ext-compaction-ai/compaction_ai.ail:104:func summarize_attempt(...)
packages/motoko-ext-compaction-ai/compaction_ai.ail:106:  match ctx.ports.ai_step(model, prompt_msgs) {
packages/motoko-ext-compaction-ai/compaction_ai.ail:119:export func summarize_with_ai_result(...)
packages/motoko-ext-compaction-ai/compaction_ai.ail:120:  summarize_attempt(...)
packages/motoko-ext-compaction-ai/compaction_ai.ail:484:    else match summarize_with_ai_result(...) {
packages/motoko-ext-compaction-ai/compaction_ai.ail:498:export func compact_with_ai(...)
packages/motoko-ext-compaction-ai/compaction_ai.ail:515:          else match summarize_with_ai_result(...) {
```

The four normative statements also drift: D1:365 says “can reach the port”; D5:941 says “reaches a
non-world-mediated seam”; D5:981-982 and classifier 2 say “references a ... field”; and the acceptance
row at ADR:1397 says “reaching a ... field from an un-excluded hook.” Only the reference-site
predicate is answered by the named textual scan.

**Action:** use one predicate everywhere. Either extend the versioned site-to-hook attribution
artifact to extension-package classifier-2 sites and make validation consume it, or adopt the coarser
mechanical rule that any installed extension containing such a reference must exclude every hook it
registers. The narrower per-hook rule is not a gate until one of those detectors exists.

### R4. Clause 3's site-to-hook attribution table is an intention, not a specified artifact, and an incorrect attribution can still fail open

**Defect:** The table has a name and a conservative default but no producer, schema, storage/version
slot, correctness rule, drift check, or validator, so nothing prevents falsely attributing an
unconditional site to an uninstalled hook and removing it from the routing obligation.

**Grounding:** clause 3 introduces the table at ADR:862-866 and its un-attributed fallback at
ADR:878-882. The complete versioned profile record at ADR:910-919 has seven fields and does not include
the table; the manifest at ADR:921-923 does not include it either. By contrast, D6's event-vocabulary
artifact at ADR:1207-1240 specifies contents, load-time validation, a manifest slot, a version-change
rule, and a prohibition on scheduling dependent checks before it exists.

Failing an *un-attributed* in-boundary core site into clause 1 is conservative: it forces excess
routing rather than omitting routing. That does not protect against a wrong positive attribution, and
the mechanical rule should be scoped explicitly to effect sites after the simulation boundary at
ADR:962-965 so pre-boundary setup is not silently pulled into the world.

**Action:** add the table to the versioned profile definition and specify: the construction owner; a
source-revision-bound schema; the correctness condition that site execution implies activation of at
least one attributed hook; how that implication is derived or independently checked; load-time
validation that fails closed on missing, stale, unknown, or malformed entries; and a prohibition on
D4/D5 routing-completeness claims before the table exists and validates. Then use the same artifact
for R3 if the per-hook classifier-2 rule is retained.

### R5. Implementation Handoff item 2 still states the conformance claim that this pass says it overturned

**Defect:** The handoff still says every profile installing an `ai_step`-calling extension remains
non-conformant, contradicting the new coverage-cost/profile-rejection split in D1, D5, Consequences,
and the acceptance table.

**Grounding:** ADR:1558-1561 says:

```text
**This item does not fix the extension model path**, and that is a decision, not an oversight:
`ext_ai_step` reaches the same seam through an ABI that cannot return a successor (D1). It fixes
the main loop, and profiles installing an `ai_step`-calling extension stay non-conformant until
the world-token ABI lands.
```

The contrary corrected statements are ADR:353-378, ADR:939-947, ADR:1397, and ADR:1511-1516.

**Action:** rewrite Handoff item 2 in the same vocabulary as D1/D5: such a profile is conformant only
when all reaching hooks are explicitly excluded, and definition validation rejects it otherwise.
Re-run the body-only searches for `non-conformant`, `conformance-eligible`, and `disqualif` after the
edit.

### R6. The Status block records four delta reviews where the reviewed commit contains six, and it contradicts that count twice

**Defect:** ADR:6-7 counts only the second- and third-pass delta reviews even though the two
fourth-pass reviews are already the tenth and eleventh committed sections at baseline `b042757`; the
same block then says “the two delta reviews” at ADR:9 and attributes fourth-pass evidence to “the four
delta reviews” at ADR:29-32.

**Grounding:** exact command and output at the reviewed commit:

```text
$ git show e8242f1:.agent/projects/009_motoko_dst_execution/ADR-001-deterministic-test-world-architecture.md | rg -n '^## Review Comments$'
1698:## Review Comments
2158:## Review Comments

4021:## Review Comments
4299:## Review Comments
4749:## Review Comments
5135:## Review Comments
5590:## Review Comments
```

Sections 1-2 are full reviews, 3-5 are F1-F6 verifications, and 6-11 are six delta reviews — two each
of correction passes two, three, and four.

**Action:** say “six independent delta reviews (two each of the second, third, and fourth correction
passes)” and make ADR:9 and ADR:29-32 use the same six-review history.

### R7. `compaction_ai` registers eight hooks, not one, leaving its remaining per-hook classifications unstated

**Defect:** ADR:373 says excluding `on_pre_step` disables the extension's “only hook,” but the
extension registers eight hooks and three of the seven constant-returning hooks carry broad declared
effect rows.

**Grounding:** `packages/motoko-ext-compaction-ai/register.ail:99-110` registers
`on_describe_tools`, `on_build_system_prompt`, `on_budget_plan`, `on_pre_step`, `on_tool_policy`,
`on_tool_handle`, `on_response_intercept`, and `on_solver_candidate` fields; excluding the required
`provided_tools` field leaves eight hooks. Only `on_pre_step` calls `compact_with_ai`, but
`on_tool_handle`, `on_response_intercept`, and `on_solver_candidate` declare
`{IO, Process, FS, AI, Env, Net, SharedMem, Clock, Stream}` while returning constants.

**Action:** change “only hook” to “only non-trivial hook and the only hook that reaches `ai_step`,”
and state whether D5's interim per-hook classification is based on performed effects or declared
effect rows. The profile-definition record must classify all eight hooks even if only one requires
classifier-2 exclusion.

### R8. Two replacement anchors are still factually wrong: the compose hook range is truncated and three dummy-hook guard lines are cited as call lines

**Defect:** ADR:781 presents `:761-771` as the enclosing `on_response_intercept` range although the
function closes at `:790`, while ADR:884-886 describes five cited call lines as five syntactic guard
sites even though three guards begin earlier.

**Grounding:** source locations; the second command's call arguments are abbreviated in the displayed
output because the cited line numbers, rather than the elided arguments, ground the finding:

```text
$ awk 'NR==761 || NR==767 || NR==771 || NR==790 || NR==792 {printf "%d: %s\n", NR, $0}' packages/motoko-ext-compose/compose.ail
761: export func on_response_intercept(ctx: ExtCtx, response_text: string, mode: string, snippet_caps: string) -> ResponseInterceptDecision ! {IO, Process, FS, Clock} {
767:       let name = "inline_${show(now())}";
771:       let _ = writeFile(path, "${compose_module_header(name)}\n\n${clean}");
790: }
792: func no_budget_patch() -> BudgetPatch {

$ rg -n 'is_test_dummy|emit_dummy_hook' src/core/ext/runtime.ail
206:      let _ = if is_test_dummy(h.id) then emit_dummy_hook(...) else ();
222:      let _ = if is_test_dummy(h.id) then emit_dummy_hook(...) else ();
239:      let _ = if is_test_dummy(h.id) then {
245:        emit_dummy_hook(...)
280:  let _ = if is_test_dummy(h.id) then {
287:    emit_dummy_hook(...)
368:  let _ = if is_test_dummy(h.id) then {
374:    emit_dummy_hook(...)
```

The mixed-guard counterexample is correctly anchored at `src/core/tool_phase.ail:222`, with the
effectful `exec_scratchpad_cell_ws` call at `:223`. The `ExtPorts` and `ai_step` anchors at
`types.ail:62-67` and `compaction_ai.ail:106` are also correct.

**Action:** cite `on_response_intercept` as `:761-790` (or cite only the clock site at `:767`), and
separate the dummy-hook call sites `206,222,245,287,374` from their guard starts
`206,222,239,280,368`. Update the Status statement from four to five consecutive correction passes
with anchor defects.

## What is accurate

All confirmations below were re-run against `e8242f1` and pinned AILANG v0.26.0.

**A1 ruling — the line is conceptually correct and its timing argument is sound, but the stated rule
has no complete detector.** An excluded hook is named as uncovered and fails closed if runtime
dispatch reaches it (ADR:935-937). An un-excluded `ai_step` path returns only
`Result[string, string]` through `ExtPorts` (`types.ail:63`) and only a decision through
`on_pre_step`; after the interim `Ports.model_step` widening there is no return channel for the
successor, so discarding it completes silently. Definition-time rejection is therefore the correct
side of the timing boundary. R3 is why it is not enforceable yet.

“Conformant and inert” is honest profile bookkeeping, not coverage laundering, provided the result
continues to name every excluded hook and awards it no coverage, as ADR:935-940 requires. A fully
excluded extension contributes no extension-path evidence; that makes the profile low-utility, not
dishonest. The ADR already warns that this must not be represented as a conformant *and covering*
`default` (ADR:370-378). The implementation report should keep conformance and hook coverage visibly
separate; D11's class/branch counters do not replace that disclosure.

**A2 ruling — classifier 2 is not correctly bounded.** Its literal criterion selects all four fields,
its intended criterion selects one, “retired field by field” does not match the one scheduled
ABI-major change, and classifier 1's soundness boundary cannot be inherited wholesale by a different
kind of matcher. R2 states the required correction.

**A3 ruling — clause 3 is still an intention rather than a buildable artifact.** Its necessity-not-
sufficiency attribution semantics are the right response to mixed guards, and missing attribution
failing into clause 1 is conservative for post-boundary routing sites. It lacks the production and
validation contract needed to make either that claim or an incorrect-positive attribution safe.

**Classifier arithmetic confirmed, but not completeness.** The corrected arithmetic is exact:

```text
$ ailang builtins list -json | python3 -c 'import json,sys; d=json.load(sys.stdin)["builtins"]; imp=[b for b in d if b["is_pure"] is False]; print("rows",len(d),"impure",len(imp),"pure",sum(b["is_pure"] is True for b in d)); print("labels",len({b["effect"] for b in imp}),sorted({b["effect"] for b in imp})); print("groups",len({"Pure" if b["is_pure"] else b["effect"] for b in d})); print("modules",len({b["module"] for b in imp}),"non_std",[(b["name"],b["module"]) for b in imp if not b["module"].startswith("std/")])'
rows 324 impure 115 pure 209
labels 17 ['AI', 'Clock', 'Cog', 'DOM', 'Debug', 'Env', 'FS', 'IO', 'Msg', 'Net', 'Process', 'Rand', 'Secret', 'SharedIndex', 'SharedMem', 'Stream', 'Trace']
groups 18
modules 21 non_std []
```

`ailang.toml:53-54` lists twelve `[effects] max` labels. Thus seventeen effect labels plus `Pure`, the
explicit `Pure` filter, 21 projected effect-bearing modules, no non-`std/*` impure rows, and the count
of twelve are all correct. R1 rules that the 21-module projection is necessary but not sufficient.

**Clock arithmetic and routing state confirmed.** `rg -n '\bnow\(\)' src packages -g '*.ail'`
returns thirteen live reads: four in `session.ail`, one in `ext/runtime.ail`, and eight in the compose
package. None has been replaced by a world-clock call at HEAD. With the runtime site correctly
attributed to `test_dummy`, the installation-scoped counts remain 4 / 12 / 13. Until R4's table exists,
however, that attribution is not valid gate evidence and the fail-closed fallback would count the
runtime site unconditionally.

**Configuration and remaining anchors confirmed.** The exact configuration recount was:

```text
$ git ls-files '.motoko/config/*/config.json' | wc -l
14
$ git ls-files '.motoko/config/*/config.json' | xargs -n1 jq -r '(.extensions.order // []) | index("compaction_ai") != null' | sort | uniq -c
     14 true
```

`types.ail:62-67`, `tool_phase.ail:222`, `compose.ail:767`, and `compaction_ai.ail:106` are accurate;
R8 records the two range/form errors.

**Status metrics confirmed independently.** The finding counts for review sections 6-9 are
`7 + 8 = 15` for the second-pass round and `6 + 6 = 12` for the third-pass round. The six
anchor/provenance findings in the former are sections 6 R4/R5/R7 and 7 R5/R6/R7. Narrowly defined as
edit provenance, section 7 R5 is one of fifteen and the third-pass round has none. The two third-pass
anchor findings are sections 8 R6 and 9 R6, both on the same deferred `stub_step.ail` comment range.
Thus “six of fifteen,” “two of twelve,” and “one of fifteen against none” hold; the header's count of
four delta reviews does not.

**Collateral consistency confirmed subject to the findings.** D11 reports fault-class and
production-branch reach, not hook coverage, and does not contradict the split. D5's profile record
has the three required per-hook classifications — effect-free, world-mediated, excluded — although
R4 shows it omits the attribution table and R7 shows all registered hooks still require a
classification. Consequences uses the corrected split. D1, D5's exclusion paragraph, D5 validation,
and the acceptance row agree on coverage versus definition-time rejection in substance, but their
reach/reference predicates drift as R3 records. Handoff item 2 is the one remaining normative
disqualification statement (R5).

## Recommended pre-acceptance actions

**This ADR must fix, in dependency order:**

1. Close classifier 1's full-stdlib completeness hole (R1); the routing inventory cannot be cited
   while source-defined effect modules are invisible.
2. Define classifier 2's actual one-field criterion and its own matcher boundary (R2).
3. Specify and version the site-to-hook artifact, including correctness, production, validation, and
   scheduling rules (R4).
4. Normalize the coverage/rejection predicate and make classifier 2 consume that artifact, or adopt
   the conservative extension-level rule (R3).
5. Correct the remaining conformance contradiction and state how all eight `compaction_ai` hooks are
   classified (R5, R7).
6. Correct the review history and both anchors, then re-run body-wide terminology and anchor checks
   (R6, R8).

**Belongs to the implementation plan, after the ADR defines the contracts:**

- Build both classifiers, derive them on the repin milestone, and wire fail-closed profile-load
  validation.
- Produce the initial source-revision-bound site-to-hook table and its drift validator.
- Implement runtime exclusion dispatch and profile-definition rejection, with separate conformance
  and per-hook coverage reporting.
- Name and validate the first useful narrow profile; no checked-in configuration supplies covering
  `compaction_ai` behavior under the interim ABI.

## Accept / revise recommendation

**Revise — the fifth pass's coverage-versus-rejection timing is sound, but neither classifier nor the
attribution artifact is yet a complete enforceable gate, and R5-R8 leave normative/history/anchor
contradictions. The upstream API blocker remains fully in force and unchanged: acceptance still
requires a recorded-stream API in an actual AILANG release, this repository repinned to that release,
and the positive integration probe passing; the fork prototype clears none of those conditions.**

## Review Comments

**Reviewer:** independent delta review of the **sixth correction pass**, fresh session, no context
from the correcting side.
**Model:** `claude-opus-5`.
**Date:** 2026-08-01.
**Reviewed at:** `c45473c` (HEAD), covering `d1b5c14..c45473c` — the pass commit `6eca7fe` plus the
delta-review-count follow-up. Baseline `d1b5c14` is the two fifth-pass delta reviews committed
verbatim before any response. Section count verified by execution at both commits: thirteen
`## Review Comments` sections at `6eca7fe` and at `c45473c`; **this is the fourteenth.**
**Toolchain:** `AILANG v0.26.0` (commit `3b52a24`), matching `ailang.toml` `>=0.26.0` and
`scripts/install-prerequisites.sh:39` `AILANG_REF="v0.26.0"`.
**Verdict: Revise.** Four of the eight answered findings are correct and land. Three of the pass's
own headline claims are false against the document it produced, and one fifth-pass finding was
answered at a different site than the one it was raised against, leaving the defect verbatim.

### R1. Read as written, the extension-granularity predicate rejects the ADR's own "first *useful* interim profile" — both guards textually reference `ai_step`

D1:366-388 makes the predicate "the extension **contains a classifier-2 field reference**", explicitly
"textual", explicitly "decidable **today** from a grep", and explicitly *not* reachability. Run that
grep. It does not select two packages; it selects five, and two of them are `empty_stop_guard` and
`progress_contract_guard` — the exact pair D1:393-396 and ADR:1026 name as the first useful interim
profile.

```text
$ for d in packages/*/; do n=$(grep -rl "ai_step" "$d" --include=*.ail | wc -l); \
    [ "$n" -gt 0 ] && echo "$(basename $d): $n file(s)"; done
motoko-ext-abi: 1 file(s)
motoko-ext-compaction-ai: 1 file(s)
motoko-ext-empty-stop-guard: 1 file(s)
motoko-ext-progress-contract-guard: 1 file(s)
motoko_ext_conformance: 2 file(s)

$ grep -rn "ai_step" packages/motoko-ext-empty-stop-guard/
packages/motoko-ext-empty-stop-guard/empty_stop_guard.ail:52:func noop_ai_step(...)
packages/motoko-ext-empty-stop-guard/empty_stop_guard.ail:53:  Err("ext ai_step port unavailable")
packages/motoko-ext-empty-stop-guard/empty_stop_guard.ail:70:    ai_step: noop_ai_step,
```

`packages/motoko-ext-progress-contract-guard/progress_contract_guard.ail:136,137,154` is the same
shape: a `noop_ai_step` stub and an `ai_step:` field construction, both in the package's own unit-test
scaffolding. Under D1's predicate as written, a profile installing either guard must exclude **all
eight** hooks it registers or be rejected — which excludes `on_solver_candidate`, where both guards'
entire behaviour lives (`register.ail:34-36` → `decide`). The narrow purpose-built profile is
therefore not merely coverage-limited; it is inert or rejected.

The pass avoided seeing this because it counted *call* sites, not references. **ADR:1181 states "the
only two `ai_step` references are `packages/motoko-ext-compaction-ai/compaction_ai.ail:106` and
`packages/motoko_ext_conformance/fixtures/reject_fixtures.ail:90`". That claim is false as written**;
it is true only of `ctx.ports.ai_step(` call sites:

```text
$ grep -rn "\.ai_step(" src packages --include=*.ail
packages/motoko-ext-compaction-ai/compaction_ai.ail:106:  match ctx.ports.ai_step(model, prompt_msgs) {
packages/motoko_ext_conformance/fixtures/reject_fixtures.ail:90:  let summary = match ctx.ports.ai_step(ctx.model, msgs) {
```

So the rule is decidable from a grep, as claimed — and the grep decides the wrong thing. The coarse
rule's stated virtue (decidability) and its stated cost ("it costs only the ability to keep one hook
of a referencing extension", D1:378) are both mis-stated: the cost is every hook of five packages,
including both guards and the ABI package itself.

This also answers the scope question the pass left open. `motoko-ext-abi` is not an extension and
`motoko_ext_conformance` is not registrable — `grep -n conformance src/core/ext/registry_generated.ail`
returns nothing — but the ADR never defines which packages the predicate ranges over, so nothing in
the text excludes them.

**Action:** decide, in one sentence, whether the predicate ranges over *field-access sites on an
`ExtPorts`-typed value* (`ctx.ports.ai_step`, two sites) or over *any textual occurrence of the field
name* (five packages), and make D1:378, D1:393, D5:1013-1017, ADR:1181 and the acceptance row all say
the chosen one. If it is the former, "textual reference" is the wrong name for it and the grep must be
specified as `\.<field>(` on an `ExtPorts` binding — which reintroduces exactly the alias/wrapper
blindness classifier 2's matcher-boundary paragraph (ADR:1174-1183) already concedes. Also state
whether non-registrable packages (`motoko-ext-abi`, `motoko_ext_conformance`) are in scope.

---

### R2. The fifth pass's R2 Action was applied to classifier 2 but not to the D5 bullet it cited by line number; the self-defeating clock contradiction survives verbatim

The fifth-pass review at ADR:6189-6213 located the contradiction precisely — "D5:980-982 then fails
profile-definition validation closed 'when an installed extension references a non-world-mediated
`ExtPorts` field from a hook the profile has not excluded'… The prescribed remedy triggers the
prescribed rejection, six lines apart" — and its Action required reconciling that bullet. The pass
adopted the reviewer's replacement criterion into classifier 2 (ADR:1155-1160, verbatim from the
Action's wording) and **did not touch the cited bullet**:

```text
$ git show 6eca7fe -- .../ADR-001-*.md | grep -c "non-world-mediated .ExtPorts. field from a hook"
0
$ git show d1b5c14:.../ADR-001-*.md | grep -n "non-world-mediated \`ExtPorts\` field from a hook"
982:  non-world-mediated `ExtPorts` field from a hook the profile has not excluded** (classifier 2).
```

At HEAD it is ADR:1055-1056, three lines below the clock bullet at ADR:1048-1051 that makes routing
`compose`'s eight reads **into** `ExtPorts.clock_now` a conformance precondition. `clock_now` is a
non-world-mediated field; the bullet therefore rejects the profile that does what the bullet above it
requires. The contradiction the pass diagnosed at length in classifier 2 ("under that reading the
clock bullet above becomes self-defeating", ADR:1163-1167) is still live at the site the reviewer
named. The same bullet is also still **per-hook** ("from a hook the profile has not excluded"), not
extension-granularity.

**Action:** rewrite ADR:1055-1056 to the adopted predicate — installed extension, classifier-2 field,
extension granularity — and drop "non-world-mediated" from it entirely, since that phrase is now the
name of a rejected membership criterion.

---

### R3. The Status block still carries the abandoned "every hook reaching the port" predicate, in the paragraph that asserts the rule "is now stated once"

ADR:41-44:

> exclusion costs *coverage*, not conformance. The rule is now stated once, in D5's vocabulary — every
> hook **reaching the port** must be an explicitly excluded hook, and installing such an extension
> *without* excluding **those hooks** is a profile-definition rejection

That is the call-graph phrasing D1:371-374 declares abandoned ("An earlier revision said 'every hook
that *can reach* the port' — a call-graph property with no instrument"). Combined with R2, the pass's
headline claim at D1:384-388 — "**One predicate, used everywhere** … The rule is **references**, at
extension granularity, and **every site now says so**" — is false at two of six sites. Inventory at
HEAD:

| Site | Predicate |
|---|---|
| Status ADR:41-44 | "every hook **reaching the port**" — stale, call-graph |
| D1 ADR:366-388 | references / every hook it registers — **adopted** |
| D5 exclusion ADR:1013-1017 | references classifier-2 field / any hook it registers — **adopted** |
| D5 validation bullet ADR:1055-1056 | "**non-world-mediated** field from **a hook** not excluded" — stale on both axes (R2) |
| Acceptance row ADR:1519 | references classifier-2 field / registering an un-excluded hook — **adopted** |
| Impl. Handoff ADR:1683 | every hook that extension registers — **adopted** |

**Action:** restate ADR:41-44 in the adopted predicate, and change "stated once" to "stated at six
sites, all in the same words" — which is what the pass actually attempted and is the honest claim.

---

### R4. `ExtensionHooks` fixes effect rows at the ABI, so the declared-not-performed rule makes the coverage floor vacuous *and* makes the pure-guard interim profile inert

The sixth pass added two rules in the same edit and neither was checked against the ABI type they
range over. `packages/motoko-ext-abi/types.ail:151-165` declares `ExtensionHooks` as a **closed record
whose per-field effect rows are properties of the ABI, not of the extension**:

```text
$ sed -n '151,165p' packages/motoko-ext-abi/types.ail
export type ExtensionHooks = {
  id: string,
  provided_tools: [string],
  on_describe_tools: () -> [ToolSchema],                        <- pure, ABI-fixed
  on_build_system_prompt: (ExtCtx) -> PromptPatch,              <- pure, ABI-fixed
  on_budget_plan: (ExtCtx, BudgetPlan) -> BudgetPatch ! {Env, FS},
  on_pre_step: ... ! {IO, Process, FS, AI, Env, Net, SharedMem, Clock, Stream},
  on_tool_policy: (ExtCtx, ToolCallEnvelope) -> ToolPolicyDecision,   <- pure, ABI-fixed
  on_tool_handle: ... ! {IO, Process, FS, AI, Env, Net, SharedMem, Clock, Stream},
  on_response_intercept: ... ! {IO, ...},
  on_solver_candidate: ... ! {IO, ...}
}
```

Three consequences, none of which the pass accounts for:

1. **"Every hook it registers" is always all eight, for every extension** — the record is closed, so
   the field set is not a per-extension fact and reading `register.ail` cannot narrow it. D1:377-378's
   refinement path ("extend D4's site-to-hook attribution table to extension packages and have this
   rule read it") is therefore the *only* possible refinement; `register.ail` will never supply one.
2. **The coverage floor is vacuous.** D5:993-1001 requires "at least one hook of every extension it
   installs" to be covered, where covered means effect-free or world-mediated (D5:979-984). Every
   extension has three ABI-pure hooks by construction, and in this repo all three are constant
   lambdas (`on_describe_tools: \_ . []` etc.). A profile that installs all fourteen configured
   extensions and excludes every hook with behaviour satisfies the floor by covering
   `on_describe_tools`. That is precisely the "installs everything and excludes everything"
   configuration D5:993-995 says the floor exists to forbid.
3. **The pure-guard interim profile is inert.** ADR:1026 says "pure guards and deterministic fixture
   hooks may form the initial profile." Both guards' logic is `export **pure** func decide`
   (`empty_stop_guard.ail:40`, `progress_contract_guard.ail:120`) — genuinely effect-free — but it is
   reached only through `on_solver_candidate`, whose row the ABI fixes at the full nine effects
   (`register.ail:34-36` in both packages). Under "classification reads *declared* effect rows"
   (D5:1002-1012), that hook is effectful, hence not coverable, hence excludable only. There are no
   pure guards under the pass's own rule.

**Action:** state the floor over *hooks the profile classifies as covered and that carry behaviour*,
or over a named minimum set, not "at least one hook" — otherwise delete it, because as written it
constrains nothing. Separately, either carve the three ABI-pure slots out of the declared-effects rule
explicitly, or withdraw ADR:1026's "pure guards … may form the initial profile", which the rule
contradicts.

---

### R5. The `ai_step` exemption from the coverage floor has no slot in the profile-definition record and no clause in the acceptance row, so the acceptance gate as written fails all fourteen checked-in configurations

D5:998-1000 and the Implementation Handoff at ADR:1683-1685 both require the exemption to be "named
as such in the profile definition". The versioned profile definition at ADR:959-970 has eight
bullets, and none of them is an exemption slot — the closest, "included extension ids and per-hook
classifications (effect-free, world-mediated, or explicitly excluded)", records the exclusions but
cannot distinguish a licensed floor exemption from a floor violation.

The acceptance row is worse than ambient — it is contradictory. ADR:1519 ends:

> and every installed extension has at least one covered hook (the coverage floor).

with no exemption clause. All fourteen checked-in configurations install `compaction_ai`
(settled, re-confirmed by every prior round), which under the extension-granularity rule must have all
eight hooks excluded and therefore has **zero** covered hooks. The acceptance row as written fails
every checked-in configuration, including the one D1:392-396 says is the intended interim disposition.

**Action:** add a ninth bullet to ADR:959-970 — "coverage-floor exemptions, each naming the extension,
the substrate limit that forces full exclusion, and the classifier-2 field involved" — and append
"except extensions carrying a recorded coverage-floor exemption" to ADR:1519.

---

### R6. The attribution table's correctness condition is not checkable by the validator the same bullet list defines, and the text claims otherwise

ADR:918-922 lists four load-time checks: site neither in table nor unconditional-core; entry naming an
uninstalled or unknown hook; stale source-revision binding; malformed row. All four are schema,
staleness and referential-integrity checks. None tests the correctness condition at ADR:911-914 —
"installation of at least one attributed hook is a *necessary* condition of the site executing" —
because necessity is a control-path property, which is what ADR:913-914 itself says the clause exists
to avoid computing.

Concrete failure: attribute `src/core/rpc.ail:200` (`get_hint`, reaching
`src/core/cache.ail:60` → `std/sem.ail:374` at `! {SharedMem}`) to `test_dummy`. Row well-formed ✓,
hook known ✓, binding fresh ✓, site present ✓ — validator passes. A profile not installing
`test_dummy` now drops a live core `SharedMem` read from its profile-reachable set and certifies
routing completeness over it. That is the exact fail-open clause 3 was rewritten to close, re-entering
through the artifact.

The sentence at ADR:920-922 — "which is why the correctness condition is stated as a checkable claim
rather than left to the author's judgement" — is a non-sequitur. Stating a condition precisely does
not make it machine-checkable, and the pass's own bullet list is the evidence.

**Action:** say plainly that necessity is **manually reviewed and unchecked by the validator**, and
require the profile definition to record a named reviewer per attribution row. If a mechanical check
is wanted, the one available over-approximation is *syntactic dominance*: require every attributed
site to be textually dominated by a guard mentioning the attributed hook id — which
`src/core/ext/runtime.ail`'s `if is_test_dummy(h.id)` at `:206, :222, :239, :280, :368` already
satisfies, and which is decidable by the same textual inventory D5 obligation 2 builds.

---

### R7. Classifier 1's stdlib source-scan pattern is both incomplete and over-broad, and the `std/*.ail` glob misses a subdirectory module

The prescribed pattern is `export func … ! {…}` with a non-empty row over
`~/.local/share/ailang/std/*.ail` (ADR:1116-1120). Three defects, all executed:

**(a) Multi-line signatures are missed. `std/process` has zero matches.**

```text
$ cd ~/.local/share/ailang/std && grep -cE '^export func .*! \{[^}]+\}' process.ail
0
$ sed -n '59,62p' process.ail
export func exec(
  cmd: string, args: [string]
) -> Result[ProcessOutput, ProcessError] ! {Process} {
```

Sixteen such multi-line effectful exports exist across `ai.ail`, `net.ail`, `process.ail`, `smoke.ail`
and `zip.ail`. At HEAD the union rescues all of them — `std/process` is in the builtin projection — so
this is not a live fail-open today. It is a fail-open *mechanism*, in the half of the classifier that
was added precisely because the other half was found insufficient.

**(b) Effect-*polymorphic* rows are counted as effect-bearing, and the module flagged is `std/list`.**

```text
$ grep -nE '^export func .*! \{[^}]+\}' list.ail
193:export func mapE[a, b, e](f: (a) -> b ! {e}, xs: [a]) -> [b] ! {e} {
204:export func filterE[a, e](p: (a) -> bool ! {e}, xs: [a]) -> [a] ! {e} {
215:export func foldlE[a, b, e](f: (b, a) -> b ! {e}, acc: b, xs: [a]) -> b ! {e} {
226:export func flatMapE[a, b, e](f: (a) -> [b] ! {e}, xs: [a]) -> [b] ! {e} {
237:export func forEachE[a, e](f: (a) -> () ! {e}, xs: [a]) -> () ! {e} {
```

`e` is an effect variable, not an effect. The scan therefore adds `std/list` to the detection set, and
the mandatory reconciliation then makes every `std/list` import a fail-closed triage candidate — the
outcome ADR:1131-1133 names as the canonical symptom of a badly-built gate ("a gate treating all
eighteen output groups as effect-bearing would flag every `std/list` import").

**(c) The glob is `std/*.ail`; `std/ai/streaming.ail` is a subdirectory module with six `! {Stream}`
exports (`:100,113,149,172,178,183`) and is matched by neither half of the union** — the builtin
projection carries `std/ai`, not `std/ai/streaming`. No repo module imports it today
(`grep -rnoE 'import +std/[a-z_]+/[a-z_]+' src packages` returns nothing), so this too is latent.

**Reproducibility of the path is fine and should be said so in the ADR.** `~/.local/share/ailang` is
not an arbitrary user-home location: it is a git clone at the pinned ref, created identically by
`scripts/install-prerequisites.sh:569-579` and by `.github/workflows/verify-extensions.yml:70-72`.
The residual risk is that `AILANG_REF="v0.26.0"` is a mutable tag and an existing clone is updated by
`git checkout` rather than re-cloned.

**Action:** (i) make the pattern signature-scoped rather than line-scoped, or state that the scan runs
on a signature-normalised stream; (ii) exclude rows whose every element is a lower-case effect
variable; (iii) glob `std/**/*.ail`; (iv) state in the ADR that the scan root is the pinned
`install-prerequisites.sh` clone and require the derivation to record the resolved commit
(`git -C ~/.local/share/ailang rev-parse HEAD`) alongside the derived set.

---

### R8. Anchors and arithmetic introduced by this pass — one range off by a line at each end, one count off by one

Every anchor the pass introduced was re-derived. **These hold:** `~/.local/share/ailang/std/sem.ail:374,385`;
`std/extension.ail:27`; `src/core/cache.ail:29,60,75`; `src/core/rpc.ail:200`;
`packages/motoko-ext-omnigraph/register.ail:4`;
`packages/motoko_ext_conformance/fixtures/reject_fixtures.ail:90`;
`packages/motoko-ext-compaction-ai/compaction_ai.ail:106`; `packages/motoko-ext-compose/compose.ail:767`
and the corrected `:761-790` (`on_response_intercept` closes at `:790`); and both
`src/core/ext/runtime.ail` lists — guards at `206, 222, 239, 280, 368`, calls at `206, 222, 245, 287,
374`, with `now()` at `:190`. The corrected `:761-790` and the guard/call separation are clean fixes.

**Two defects:**

- **ADR:392 / `register.ail:99-110`.** The eight-hook count is correct, but the range is not: line 99
  is `provided_tools: []` (not a hook) and line 110 is the record's closing `}`. The eight hooks span
  `:100-109`. The anchor was inherited verbatim from the fifth-pass review at ADR:6864 and never
  re-derived.
- **ADR:1007-1009 — "three of `compaction_ai`'s seven trivial hooks declare exactly that row".** True
  of *that* row, but the conclusion drawn ("so they classify as effectful and need exclusion") applies
  to **four**: `on_budget_plan` (`register.ail:102`) declares `! {Env, FS}`, which is also non-empty
  and also not effect-free. Of the seven trivial hooks, three are pure and four are effectful.

**Action:** `:100-109`; and "four of the seven trivial hooks declare a non-empty row — three the full
nine-effect row, `on_budget_plan` `! {Env, FS}`".

---

### R9. D4 asserts the 4 / 12 / 13 split flatly and denies its derivability sixty lines later

ADR:817-821 states without qualification that a profile installing neither `compose` nor `test_dummy`
"has **four** sites to route", one installing `compose` "has **twelve**", and one installing both
"all **thirteen**". ADR:925-930, added by this pass, says: "Until then 'four driver clock reads' is not
a derivable number: without an attribution for `src/core/ext/runtime.ail:190`, the fail-closed default
counts it as unconditional core and the driver obligation is five."

The arithmetic itself survives — 4 + 8 = 12, +1 = 13 — and D4's count of 13 is settled. But the
pre-table numbers are 5 / 13 / 13, which collapses the twelve-versus-thirteen distinction the table's
third row exists to draw. One of the two passages must yield.

**Action:** add "once the attribution table validates" to ADR:819, and change ADR:927 from "is not a
derivable number" to "is not yet derived — pre-table the split is 5 / 13 / 13".

---

### R10. The coverage floor is asserted in the acceptance row with no producing artifact, and no reporting requirement anywhere

Every other clause of ADR:1519-1521 names its evidence — the manifest, the exclusion list, D11's
branch-reached counters read from D3's catalogue. The floor names none. D11's counters are
fault-class and branch-reached (ADR:1480, 1527); nothing in D11 counts hooks, and no result field
anywhere requires per-hook coverage to be reported. The floor is the only acceptance clause in the
table that no artifact produces.

**Action:** either require the run result to report covered/excluded hook counts per installed
extension, or move the floor out of the acceptance table into D5 as a profile-definition well-formedness
rule checked at load — which is where the rest of its family already lives.

---

## What is accurate

Re-run and confirmed by execution at `c45473c` on pinned `v0.26.0`:

- **Section count.** Thirteen `## Review Comments` sections at both `6eca7fe` and `c45473c`; the
  follow-up commit's correction of the Status block from "six" to "**eight** independent delta reviews
  (two each of the second, third, fourth, and fifth correction passes)" is **correct**, and
  2 full + 3 verifications + 8 delta = 13 reconciles. The rest of the Status block is free of this
  staleness class; its one surviving defect is R3, which is a content stale, not a count stale.
- **Classifier 1's motivating case is real and correctly diagnosed.** `std/sem.ail:374,385` export
  `load_frame`/`store_frame` at `! {SharedMem}`; `src/core/cache.ail:29` imports them and calls them at
  `:60`/`:75`; `src/core/rpc.ail:200` reaches `get_hint`. `std/sem` is absent from the builtin
  projection. The second case is real too: `std/extension.ail:27` `! {FS}`, imported at
  `packages/motoko-ext-omnigraph/register.ail:4`.
- **The 21 / 21 / 10 arithmetic.** The builtin projection yields exactly 21 modules; the repo imports
  exactly 21 distinct `std/*` modules under `src` + `packages`; exactly **ten** of those have no
  derived row (`std/bytes crypto datetime extension json list option result sem string`). The claim
  at ADR:1128-1130 is confirmed to the number.
- **The reconciliation recovers both live cases.** `std/sem` and `std/extension` are both in the
  source-scan set. The seven remaining unmatched modules (`bytes crypto datetime json option result
  string`) are provably effect-free by the ADR's own criterion — zero concrete effect rows anywhere in
  their sources — so the check terminates rather than producing an unbounded triage list. Transitive
  imports are handled by construction: the criterion is a property of the imported module's own
  exported rows, and `std/sem`'s `{SharedMem}` row is what the scan reads.
- **Anchors** — the eleven listed under R8 as holding, including the two corrections the pass made.
- **`ExtPorts.clock_now` still has zero call sites; `ctx.ports.ai_step` still has exactly two.**
- **Classifier 2's rewritten membership criterion is right**, and the argument for it (ADR:1163-1172)
  is the strongest paragraph in the pass. `clock_now`, `proc_exec`, `env_get` lose no cursor;
  `ai_step` returns `Result[string, string]` and cannot carry `Ports.model_step`'s successor. Retiring
  "field by field" in favour of a single ABI major is also correct.
- **Clause 3's necessity-not-sufficiency semantics** — not reopened; R6 is about the validator only.
- **The separated guard/call line lists** and the `:761-790` correction are genuine anchor fixes.

### Three explicit rulings the handoff asked for

**A1 — are the extension-granularity rule and the coverage floor compatible? No, on two independent
grounds, and the exception is not specified well enough to be one.** (i) The floor's stated purpose is
defeated by the ABI, not by the exception: three hook slots are pure for every extension by
`ExtensionHooks`'s type, so the floor is satisfiable by covering a constant-returning no-op (R4). (ii)
The exception itself is ambient exactly as suspected — no slot in the profile-definition record at
ADR:959-970, and no clause in the acceptance row at ADR:1519, which as written fails all fourteen
checked-in configurations (R5). Separately, the coarse rule is what *creates* the collision: under
per-hook granularity `compaction_ai`'s three ABI-pure hooks would satisfy the floor without any
exception at all. **On the narrower question — is the coarse rule right as an interim gate? — yes in
principle: it is decidable and it fails closed, and requiring the attribution-table refinement up
front would have blocked the interim on an artifact that does not exist.** But its predicate must be
disambiguated before it is a gate rather than a grep (R1), and its cost is mis-stated.

**A2 — is classifier 1's source scan complete and reproducible? Reproducible yes; complete no.** The
path is a pinned git clone used identically by the installer and by CI, so the derivation is
reproducible on another machine — the ADR should say that rather than leave the path bare, and should
record the resolved commit. Completeness fails on three counts, one of which (`std/list` via `! {e}`)
produces a live false positive today and two of which (multi-line signatures, the `std/*.ail` glob) are
latent fail-opens rescued only by the union (R7). **This is the fourth consecutive revision of this
obligation to leave a completeness hole, and the pass's claim at ADR:1121-1123 that "the reason is
recorded so a fourth does not rediscover it" is itself the fourth.**

**A4 — is the attribution table's correctness condition checkable by its validator? No.** The four
listed checks are schema, staleness and referential integrity; necessity is a control-path property
the same section refuses to compute. The wrong-positive attribution is caught by nothing, and
ADR:923-925 implies otherwise (R6). A mechanical over-approximation — syntactic dominance by a guard
naming the hook id — is available and is what the ADR's own `is_test_dummy(h.id)` example exhibits.

---

## Recommended pre-acceptance actions

**This ADR must fix, in dependency order:**

1. **R1** — disambiguate the classifier-2 reference predicate (field-access site vs. textual
   occurrence) and scope it to registrable extension packages. Everything below depends on which
   reading is chosen, and under the literal reading the ADR's own interim plan is unbuildable.
2. **R3, R2** — propagate the chosen predicate to ADR:41-44 and ADR:1055-1056. R2 additionally removes
   the surviving "non-world-mediated" criterion, without which the clock gate is unreachable.
3. **R4** — restate or delete the coverage floor, and reconcile the declared-effects rule with
   ADR:1026's "pure guards may form the initial profile", which it currently contradicts.
4. **R5** — add the exemption slot to ADR:959-970 and the exemption clause to ADR:1519. Depends on 3.
5. **R6** — say that necessity is manually reviewed, and either require a recorded reviewer or adopt
   syntactic dominance as the mechanical check.
6. **R7** — fix the scan pattern (signature-scoped, effect-variable exclusion, `std/**/*.ail`) and
   record the scan root's resolved commit.
7. **R8, R9, R10** — anchor range, the three-versus-four count, the 4/12/13 conditional, and the
   floor's missing producer.

**Belongs to the implementation plan, not this ADR:** building the attribution table and both
classifiers in one change (already correctly scheduled at ADR:920-922); wiring either into CI, the
Makefile or `scripts/` — neither is wired anywhere today; the successor detector that would relax the
declared-effects rule; and extending the attribution table to extension packages, which R4(1)
establishes is the only possible route to per-hook granularity.

---

## Accept / revise

**Revise.** The pass's four substantive corrections — classifier 2's membership criterion, the
declared-versus-performed ruling, the attribution table's D6 treatment, and the two anchor fixes — are
correct and worth keeping; but R1 makes the pass's central new rule reject the profile the ADR is
built around, R2 leaves a fifth-pass finding unfixed at the line it was raised against, R3 falsifies
the pass's "every site now says so", and R4/R5 make the coverage floor simultaneously vacuous and
unsatisfiable. **The upstream API blocker is untouched by any of this and remains fully in force:
acceptance still requires the recorded-stream API in an actual AILANG release, this repository
repinned to it, and the positive integration probe passing — `arniwesth/ailang`'s
`stepWithStreamRecorded` on the `v0.31.0` tag is a prototype and clears none of those three.**

## Review Comments

**Reviewer:** independent delta review of the **sixth correction pass**, performed from source in a
fresh Codex session.
**Model:** `GPT-5`.
**Date:** 2026-08-01.
**Reviewed at:** `c45473c95765debccae2f083e1a0b86deb1f827a`, covering
`d1b5c14..c45473c` — correction commit `6eca7fe` plus the count-correction follow-up.
**Section count:** thirteen committed `## Review Comments` sections at both `6eca7fe` and
`c45473c`. A pre-existing uncommitted fourteenth section attributed to `claude-opus-5` was present
when this review began; it was preserved verbatim, and the user explicitly authorized appending this
independent review. **This is therefore the fifteenth section.**
**Toolchain:** `AILANG v0.26.0`, commit
`3b52a24d24431c372ed5605289ef039592209514`.
**Verdict: Revise.** The classifier-2 membership correction, declared-row ruling, table scheduling,
count follow-up, and changed anchors hold, but the new rejection rule, coverage floor, classifier-1
scan, and attribution-table validation are not yet coherent enforceable gates.

---

### R1. The undefined meaning of “textual reference” makes the coarse rejection predicate select the proposed guard packages' own `ExtPorts` fixture construction

**Defect:** Read literally, “an extension contains a classifier-2 field reference” includes the
`ai_step:` record fields embedded in both proposed guard packages, forcing all eight of each guard's
hooks to be excluded and making the ADR's first useful interim profile inert or rejected.

**Grounding:** the broad textual inventory and the narrower access-call inventory are different:

```text
$ rg -n 'ai_step' packages/motoko-ext-empty-stop-guard/empty_stop_guard.ail \
    packages/motoko-ext-progress-contract-guard/progress_contract_guard.ail
packages/motoko-ext-empty-stop-guard/empty_stop_guard.ail:52:func noop_ai_step(_model: string, _msgs: [Msg]) -> Result[string, string] ! {AI, IO, Process, FS, Env, Net, SharedMem, Clock, Stream} {
packages/motoko-ext-empty-stop-guard/empty_stop_guard.ail:53:  Err("ext ai_step port unavailable")
packages/motoko-ext-empty-stop-guard/empty_stop_guard.ail:70:    ai_step: noop_ai_step,
packages/motoko-ext-progress-contract-guard/progress_contract_guard.ail:136:func noop_ai_step(_model: string, _msgs: [Msg]) -> Result[string, string] ! {AI, IO, Process, FS, Env, Net, SharedMem, Clock, Stream} {
packages/motoko-ext-progress-contract-guard/progress_contract_guard.ail:137:  Err("ext ai_step port unavailable")
packages/motoko-ext-progress-contract-guard/progress_contract_guard.ail:154:    ai_step: noop_ai_step,

$ rg -n '\.ai_step\(' src packages --glob '*.ail'
packages/motoko_ext_conformance/fixtures/reject_fixtures.ail:90:  let summary = match ctx.ports.ai_step(ctx.model, msgs) {
packages/motoko-ext-compaction-ai/compaction_ai.ail:106:  match ctx.ports.ai_step(model, prompt_msgs) {
```

ADR:1181-1183's “only two `ai_step` references” is therefore true only of `.ai_step(` access calls,
not of textual occurrences or record-field references. The package scope is also undefined:
`motoko_ext_conformance` exports fixture hooks but is absent from `src/core/ext/registry_generated.ail`,
while D5:1026 expressly contemplates deterministic fixture hooks in an initial profile.

The hook set itself is decidable, but not for the reason D1 gives. All fifteen runtime
`register_with_config` functions return the closed `ExtensionHooks` record at
`packages/motoko-ext-abi/types.ail:151-165`, so every registration always has the same eight hook
fields even if its values are selected conditionally. Five `register.ail` files delegate to
`make_hooks`, so the fields are not always textually present in `register.ail`:

```text
$ rg -n '^[[:space:]]+make_hooks\(' packages/*/register.ail
packages/motoko-ext-mcp/register.ail:10:  make_hooks(cfg)
packages/motoko-ext-ailang-docs/register.ail:25:  make_hooks(workdir, timeout_ms, max_output_chars)
packages/motoko-ext-exa-search/register.ail:20:  make_hooks(workdir, timeout_ms, max_output_chars)
packages/motoko-ext-a2a/register.ail:11:  make_hooks(cfg)
packages/motoko_scratchpad/register.ail:18:  make_hooks(timeout_secs)
```

**Action:** define classifier 2's matcher as an exact syntactic/typed operation — for example, a call
through a classifier-2 field selected from an `ExtPorts`-typed value — and say whether field
declarations, record construction, strings/comments, embedded unit scaffolding, ABI packages, and
non-registry fixture packages are in scope. Cite the closed ABI, not `register.ail`, as the source of
the eight-hook set. If arbitrary textual field occurrences are intended, withdraw the useful-guard
profile claim because both guards match.

---

### R2. The pass's “one predicate, used everywhere” claim is false, and D5's surviving predicate still rejects the clock routing it requires

**Defect:** Status, D1, D5 validation, and Consequences retain the abandoned reachability or
“non-world-mediated” per-hook predicates, so the rule is neither extension-granular nor consistent
and the D5 validation bullet still makes `ExtPorts.clock_now` self-defeating.

**Grounding:** the committed body retains “hook reaching the port” at Status:42, “can reach
`ExtPorts.ai_step`” at D1:353, “excluding its reaching hooks” at D1:360, “non-world-mediated
`ExtPorts` field from a hook” at D5:1056, and “every hook that reaches the port” at
Consequences:1634. Implementation Handoff:1683 instead uses the adopted “every hook that extension
registers.”

D5:1048-1051 requires a `compose` profile to route eight reads into `ExtPorts.clock_now`; the
unchanged D5:1054-1056 bullet then rejects an un-excluded hook referencing that
“non-world-mediated” field. D1:383-388's assertion that every site now says “references, at
extension granularity” is contradicted inside the same normative body.

**Action:** after resolving R1's matcher, replace the stale predicates at Status:41-44,
D1:343-360, D5:1054-1056, and Consequences:1633-1634 with the same extension-granularity sentence
already used at D5:1013-1018 and the acceptance row; remove “non-world-mediated” from classifier-2
validation because classifier membership, not general port mediation, is the adopted criterion.

---

### R3. Rejecting attribution rows that name an uninstalled hook makes the table unable to prove that a hook-guarded site is absent

**Defect:** The validator rejects an entry naming an uninstalled hook even though absence of that
hook is exactly the fact clause 3 needs to remove the attributed site from a profile's reachable set.

**Grounding:** D4:882-883 makes a core site reachable when it is attributed to an **installed** hook;
D4:918-920 then fails profile load when a row names an **uninstalled** hook. The concrete consequence
is stated by the ADR itself at D4:931-938: `src/core/ext/runtime.ail:190` is attributable to
`test_dummy`, and no checked-in configuration installs `test_dummy`. Under the validator as written,
the table cannot retain that attribution in those profiles; if it omits the row, D4:898-900 defaults
the site into unconditional core. D4:926-929 therefore says the obligation is five, while the table
at D4:817-821 states four without qualification.

**Action:** make the attribution artifact source-global over **known** hook identities, permit rows
whose known hooks are absent from a particular profile, and compute reachability by intersecting each
row's hook set with the installed set. Reject unknown hook ids, not known-but-uninstalled ids. Then
state the clock arithmetic conditionally: before a valid attribution table it is 5 / 13 / 13; after
the `test_dummy` row validates it is 4 / 12 / 13.

---

### R4. The `ai_step` coverage-floor exception is ambient because neither the profile record nor the acceptance gate can represent it

**Defect:** D5 requires the exception to be named in the profile definition, but the exhaustive
profile record has no exemption field and the acceptance row unconditionally requires one covered
hook per installed extension.

**Grounding:** the versioned record at ADR:959-970 has eight bullets: identity, per-hook
classification, adapter/parser boundaries, resources, projections, ambient policy, D3 waivers, and
the attribution table. None records a coverage-floor exemption. D5:993-1000 names the `ai_step`
exception, while ADR:1519 ends unconditionally with “every installed extension has at least one
covered hook (the coverage floor).”

An `ai_step`-referencing extension must have all eight hooks excluded under D1/D5 and therefore has
zero covered hooks; the prose exception and automated acceptance row produce opposite results.
D11:1477-1486 reports fault-class and recovery-branch counters, not hook coverage, and no other result
field is named as the producer of floor evidence.

**Action:** add a versioned `coverage_floor_exemptions` field, with extension id, classifier-2 field,
and substrate reason; make profile-load validation consume it; add the same exception to ADR:1519;
and require the result or manifest to report each installed extension's covered/excluded hook count
and any applied exemption.

---

### R5. Declared-row classification makes the proposed pure-guard profile cover only ABI no-op slots, not either guard's behavior

**Defect:** The closed ABI gives every extension three effect-free hook types, making the new floor
easy to satisfy, while both guards' useful `on_solver_candidate` hook declares the full effect row
and must be excluded under the pass's declared-not-performed rule.

**Grounding:** `packages/motoko-ext-abi/types.ail:151-165` fixes
`on_describe_tools`, `on_build_system_prompt`, and `on_tool_policy` without an effect row, but fixes
`on_solver_candidate` at the full nine-effect row. The empty-stop guard registers the three pure
slots at `packages/motoko-ext-empty-stop-guard/register.ail:27-28,31` and its behavioral
`on_solver_candidate` at `:34-36` with
`! {IO, Process, FS, AI, Env, Net, SharedMem, Clock, Stream}`.

`progress_contract_guard/register.ail:23-37` is identical in classification shape. D5:1002-1010
forbids treating the performed-pure `decide` call as effect-free because classification reads the
registered declaration. Thus the floor is syntactically satisfiable by a no-op pure slot while the
only behavioral hook is excluded, contradicting D1:394-397 and D5:1026's claim that these pure guards
can form the first useful profile.

**Action:** define what useful hook coverage means rather than accepting any ABI slot: name at least
one required covered behavioral hook per installed extension in the profile, and for the proposed
guard profile either make `on_solver_candidate` classifiable as covered or withdraw the claim that
the profile exercises the guards. Keep D11's fault/branch counters separate, but add a profile-load
hook-coverage check and reported evidence for the acceptance row.

---

### R6. Classifier 1's source rule is neither complete over the language/toolchain tree nor reproducibly bound to the compiler being classified

**Defect:** The flat `export func` scan misses accepted effectful declaration and module-path forms,
does not define the treatment of effect variables, and reads a user-home checkout that the repository
does not guarantee matches the executing compiler.

**Grounding:** pinned v0.26.0 accepts `export pure func ... ! {Declassify}`, a declaration form outside
the stated `export func` pattern:

```text
$ (cd /home/motoko/.local/share/ailang && env XDG_CACHE_HOME=/tmp/motoko_adr_review_cache ailang check examples/runnable/contracts/inbox_injection_v2.ail)
→ Type checking examples/runnable/contracts/inbox_injection_v2.ail...
→ Effect checking...

✓ No errors found!

$ rg -n '^export pure func.*! \{[^}]+' /home/motoko/.local/share/ailang/examples/runnable/contracts/inbox_injection_v2.ail
39:export pure func sanitizeBody(rawBody: string<email>) -> string<sanitized> ! {Declassify}
66:export pure func safeForward(rawEmail: string<email>, recipient: string) -> SendAction ! {Declassify}
```

The stdlib has a nested effect-bearing module excluded by `std/*.ail`:

```text
$ rg -n '^export func|^\) ->.*! \{' /home/motoko/.local/share/ailang/std/ai/streaming.ail
100:export func openaiCompatStream(
104:) -> Result[StreamConn, StreamErrorKind] ! {AI, Stream, Net} {
113:export func anthropicStream(
117:) -> Result[StreamConn, StreamErrorKind] ! {AI, Stream, Net} {
149:export func callStream(
153:) -> Result[string, AIError] ! {AI, Stream, Net} {
172:export func onEvent(conn: StreamConn, handler: (StreamEvent) -> bool) -> unit ! {Stream} {
178:export func runEventLoop(conn: StreamConn) -> unit ! {Stream} {
183:export func disconnect(conn: StreamConn) -> unit ! {Stream} {
```

The “non-empty row” rule also selects effect variables rather than concrete ambient labels:

```text
$ rg -n '^export func.*! \{[a-z][^}]*\}' /home/motoko/.local/share/ailang/std/list.ail
193:export func mapE[a, b, e](f: (a) -> b ! {e}, xs: [a]) -> [b] ! {e} {
204:export func filterE[a, e](p: (a) -> bool ! {e}, xs: [a]) -> [a] ! {e} {
215:export func foldlE[a, b, e](f: (b, a) -> b ! {e}, acc: b, xs: [a]) -> b ! {e} {
226:export func flatMapE[a, b, e](f: (a) -> [b] ! {e}, xs: [a]) -> [b] ! {e} {
237:export func forEachE[a, e](f: (a) -> () ! {e}, xs: [a]) -> () ! {e} {
```

On this machine the checkout is correct — `git -C ~/.local/share/ailang rev-parse HEAD` returned
`3b52a24d24431c372ed5605289ef039592209514` — but the gate does not establish that. `ailang.toml:6`
is `>=0.26.0`, and `scripts/install-prerequisites.sh:554-559` returns before creating/updating
`~/.local/share/ailang` whenever any installed AILANG satisfies that floor. The later clone at
`:569-578` is reached only when installation is needed. CI creates the expected path, but from the
mutable version tag rather than a recorded commit.

**Action:** derive exported effect rows from parsed module interfaces (or a signature-normalized AST
scan) over the recursive stdlib tree belonging to the exact executable; include `export pure func`,
multiline signatures, and nested modules; specify how row variables are classified; and record and
verify the resolved stdlib commit with the classifier output. A user-home path alone must not be gate
identity.

---

### R7. The attribution validator does not check the necessity condition it presents as checkable

**Defect:** The four load-time checks establish schema, freshness, and referential integrity but do
not establish that installation of an attributed hook is necessary for the site to execute.

**Grounding:** ADR:911-914 defines necessity as the correctness condition. ADR:918-922 checks only a
missing classification, unknown/uninstalled hook, stale source binding, and malformed row. No check
relates a site's control context to its attributed hooks. After R3 permits known-but-uninstalled hook
ids so the table can function, a fresh, well-formed but false attribution of
`src/core/cache.ail:60` to `test_dummy` would satisfy those structural checks and remove a live core
`SharedMem` site from profiles without that hook. Determining the attribution is false requires the
control/path fact that the listed validator does not compute.

The post-boundary scope restriction itself is correct: ADR:915-917 matches the boundary at
ADR:1036-1039, after synthetic configuration is validated and the runtime/profile constructed, with
host discovery, hydration, and TypeScript child-process setup outside.

**Action:** state explicitly that necessity is manually reviewable and is not checked by the
load-time validator; record reviewer/evidence per attribution row, or add a conservative mechanical
proof obligation such as a checked guard/dominance anchor. Do not describe precision of the claim as
mechanical validation of its truth.

---

## What is accurate

Re-run and confirmed at `c45473c`:

- **Review count and Status follow-up.** `git show 6eca7fe:.agent/projects/009_motoko_dst_execution/ADR-001-deterministic-test-world-architecture.md
  | rg -c '^## Review Comments$'` and the same command at `HEAD` both returned `13`. Two full reviews + three
  F1–F6 verifications + eight delta reviews = thirteen, so HEAD's “eight independent delta reviews
  (two each of the second, third, fourth, and fifth correction passes)” is correct. The structural
  remedy for the two repeated count mistakes is a documentation check that derives the total from
  standardized review metadata at the commit being written, rather than another hand-written
  resolution. Status's “five consecutive passes” anchor count also remains correct: the A5 ranges
  below are valid, so this review does not manufacture a sixth anchor-error pass. Status's surviving
  content staleness is the predicate drift in R2.
- **Classifier 1's motivating cases and reconciliation.** The builtin projection contains 21
  modules; the repo imports 21 distinct `std/*` modules; the ten imported modules absent from that
  projection are `std/bytes`, `std/crypto`, `std/datetime`, `std/extension`, `std/json`, `std/list`,
  `std/option`, `std/result`, `std/sem`, and `std/string`. The source half recovers
  `std/sem` (`! {SharedMem}` at `sem.ail:374,385`) and `std/extension` (`! {FS}` at
  `extension.ail:27`). Transitive implementation is handled for these live cases because the
  importing wrapper exports its own declared row: `std/sem` imports `std/sharedmem`, and
  `std/extension` imports `std/fs`.
- **Classifier 2 membership.** The new cursor-loss criterion correctly selects `ai_step` and excludes
  `clock_now`, `proc_exec`, and `env_get`; those three are legal routing destinations because they do
  not discard a successor D1 requires returned.
- **Static hook set.** All fifteen runtime registrations return `ExtensionHooks`; the closed ABI
  always contains eight hooks. Conditional hook *values* cannot conditionally add or remove fields.
- **Declared versus performed effects.** The conservative declaration-based classification does not
  contradict D5's hermeticity probe. The former decides static coverage eligibility; the latter is a
  runtime backstop for ambient effects actually performed by reached hooks. It does, however, create
  the utility defect in R5.
- **Anchors.** Every A5 anchor holds: `std/sem.ail:374,385`; `std/extension.ail:27`;
  `src/core/cache.ail:29,60,75`; `src/core/rpc.ail:200`; omnigraph `register.ail:4`; fixture `:90`;
  compaction `:106`; the eight-hook record enclosed by `register.ail:99-110` (the eight fields are
  exactly `:100-109`); compose `:761-790` and clock call `:767`; and runtime guards
  `206,222,239,280,368` versus calls `206,222,245,287,374`. The enclosing `:99-110` range is not a
  factual anchor error merely because it also contains `provided_tools` and the record's closing
  brace. The statement that three trivial hooks declare the full nine-effect row is also true; it
  does not claim that `on_budget_plan`'s `{Env, FS}` row is pure.
- **Clock arithmetic.** The settled 4 / 12 / 13 split survives as the post-validation result; R3 is
  about the current validator and the missing qualification, not the settled repo-wide count of 13.

### Explicit rulings requested by the handoff

**A1 — extension granularity versus the coverage floor:** **not compatible as an enforceable gate in
the text produced.** D5 declares an exception, so the concepts can coexist, but there is no record
slot, acceptance clause, or evidence producer for it (R4), while the general floor can be satisfied
by ABI-pure no-op slots without covering extension behavior (R5). The coarse extension rule is an
acceptable interim precision trade in principle: it is fail-closed, its eight-hook consequence is
statically decidable from the ABI, and requiring extension site-to-hook attribution up front would
delay the interim gate. It is acceptable only after R1 precisely defines the field-access matcher and
scope; the current literal reading disables the proposed guards themselves.

**A2 — classifier 1 completeness and reproducibility:** **neither is established as specified.** The
union and reconciliation recover today's `std/sem` and `std/extension` holes, but the source pattern
omits accepted declaration/path forms and mishandles row variables, while the named home-directory
tree is not bound by the gate to the executable's resolved commit (R6). The local checkout happens to
match the pin and CI has a usable clone recipe; those facts are inputs to the repair, not proof of the
current rule.

**A4 — attribution correctness:** **necessity is not checkable by the listed validator.** Moreover,
the validator's uninstalled-hook rejection currently prevents the table from expressing the
`test_dummy` absence it is meant to exploit (R3). Once that is corrected, necessity remains a manual
or separately proven control-path property (R7). The post-simulation-boundary scope is correct.

---

## Recommended pre-acceptance actions

**This ADR must fix, in dependency order:**

1. **R1 and R2:** define the exact classifier-2 access matcher and package/test-fixture scope, ground
   the eight-hook set in the ABI, and propagate one identical predicate through Status, D1, D5,
   Consequences, the acceptance row, and the implementation handoff.
2. **R3 and R7:** make the attribution table global over known hook identities, allow known absent
   hooks during profile evaluation, state the pre/post-table clock arithmetic, and distinguish the
   structural validator from manual or mechanically evidenced necessity review.
3. **R4 and R5:** add the explicit floor-exemption record and acceptance clause, define useful
   behavioral hook coverage, identify the gate/result evidence that enforces it, and reconcile or
   withdraw the proposed pure-guard profile.
4. **R6:** replace the ad-hoc home-path pattern with a recursive parsed/signature-normalized export
   derivation bound to the resolved toolchain commit, including declaration variants and a specified
   effect-row-variable rule.
5. Add a documentation check that recounts standardized review metadata at the commit being written;
   do not repair the repeated Status-count failure with another prose-only resolution.

**Belongs to the implementation plan, not this ADR:** implement the two classifiers and attribution
producer in one source-revision-bound change; wire their profile-load validation and recorded output
into CI; implement per-extension hook coverage/exemption reporting; build the declared-versus-performed
successor detector before relaxing conservative hook classification; and optionally extend
site-to-hook attribution into extension packages if later profiles need per-hook precision. The
extension attribution refinement is not required to make the deliberately coarse interim gate sound.

---

## Accept / revise

**Revise. The upstream API blocker remains fully in force and unchanged: acceptance still requires a
recorded-stream API in an actual AILANG release, this repository repinned to that release, and the
positive integration probe passing; the `v0.31.0` fork prototype clears none of those conditions.**

## Review Comments

**Reviewer:** independent delta review of the **seventh correction pass**, performed from source in a
fresh Claude Code session with no context from the correcting session.
**Model:** `claude-opus-5`.
**Date:** 2026-08-02.
**Reviewed at:** `5fa0beaa824822671573e860e41506e234da0aa9`, covering
`d6904c4..5fa0bea` — correction commit `a3519d6` plus the extension-coverage follow-up `5fa0bea`.
**Section count:** counted at the commit reviewed, not inherited from the handoff.
`grep -c "^## Review Comments"` returns **15** at both `a3519d6` and `5fa0bea`; `(15 − 5) = 10` delta
reviews, which is what the Status block says. **This is therefore the sixteenth section.**
**Toolchain:** `AILANG v0.26.0`, commit `3b52a24d24431c372ed5605289ef039592209514`
(`ailang --version` and `git -C ~/.local/share/ailang rev-parse HEAD` agree).
**Verdict: Revise.** Classifier 1's four scan repairs are correct and I could not break them;
classifier 2's call-site narrowing is correct and its two call sites re-derive exactly; every anchor
introduced or changed in this pass is exact, for the second consecutive pass. But the pass's two
authoring choices do not hold as argued: the floor's deletion rests on a premise the follow-up commit
itself retracted and which survives verbatim three paragraphs earlier, and the "six sites, same
words" claim is false at three sites — one of which normatively states the rule the pass just retired
as actively harmful.

---

### R1. The claim commit `5fa0bea` retracted as false survives verbatim at ADR:1067–1069, where it is the load-bearing second leg of the argument for deleting the coverage floor

**Defect:** `5fa0bea` corrected "under the declared-row rule, no behaviour-carrying extension hook is
coverable today" at ADR:1089–1108, but left the identical claim standing at ADR:1067–1069, where it
is one of the two stated grounds for deleting the floor — so the ADR now asserts and denies the same
proposition three paragraphs apart.

**Grounding:**

```
$ git show 5fa0bea --stat -- .agent/projects/009_motoko_dst_execution/ADR-001-deterministic-test-world-architecture.md
 ...DR-001-deterministic-test-world-architecture.md |  28 ++-
```

The 28 changed lines are all in the block beginning `**The consequence for extension coverage …**`.
The anti-laundering paragraph above it was untouched, and still reads (ADR:1067–1069):

> In the other direction the same closed record pins every *behavioural* hook at the full nine-effect
> row, so under the declared-row rule below **no behaviour-carrying hook is coverable at all**, and
> the floor is unsatisfiable for any extension that does something.

ADR:1093–1100, immediately below, says the opposite and is the version that is right:

> The three remaining slots — `on_describe_tools`, `on_build_system_prompt`, `on_tool_policy` — carry
> no row and are coverable. … several extensions put real logic there.

Independently confirmed against the ABI rather than against the correction's own prose:

```
$ awk 'NR>=151 && NR<=165' packages/motoko-ext-abi/types.ail
```

Rowless: `on_describe_tools:151+3`, `on_build_system_prompt:155`, `on_tool_policy:158`. Pinned:
`on_budget_plan:156` at `! {Env, FS}`; `on_pre_step:157`, `on_tool_handle:159-160`,
`on_response_intercept:161-162`, `on_solver_candidate:163-164` at nine effects. So ADR:1067's "every
behavioural hook at the full nine-effect row" is wrong twice over — `on_budget_plan` is not at nine,
and three slots carry no row.

**Action:** rewrite ADR:1067–1069 to the corrected enumeration. Note that this costs the deletion
argument its second leg: with three coverable slots, the floor is **satisfiable**, not unsatisfiable.
See R2 for what remains of the first leg.

---

### R2. Deleting the floor removed the only clause that rejected the configuration the ADR names, and the replacement cannot fail on coverage state and reports a quantity that cannot distinguish that configuration

**Defect:** the pass's first leg — that the floor is "vacuous" — is overstated: the floor did reject
"installs everything and excludes everything", which is verbatim the configuration the deleted text
named as the laundering path. The replacement is a reporting obligation, so the acceptance row's new
clause fails only if the result *omits* the counts, never on what the counts say; and because the ABI
fixes the coverable set at exactly three slots for every extension, the counts a laundering profile
reports are indistinguishable from those an honest maximal profile reports.

**Grounding:** the deleted rule (ADR at `d6904c4`, D5) was "a conformant profile must cover at least
one hook of every extension it installs, or must not list the extension as installed at all." A
profile that excludes all eight hooks of an installed extension covers zero and **fails** it. The
current acceptance row (ADR:1644) reads:

> … and the result reports per-extension covered/excluded hook counts, so a profile covering only
> ABI-pure no-op slots is visible as such.

"The result reports counts" is satisfied by reporting. And the counts do not discriminate: under the
declared-row rule the coverable set is the three rowless slots for *every* extension, so
`compaction_ai` — whose three rowless slots are `\_ . []`, `\_ . {prepend: [], append: []}`, and
`\_ _ . Allow` (`packages/motoko-ext-compaction-ai/register.ail:100,101,106`) — reports the same
"3 covered / 5 excluded" as `motoko-ext-compose`, whose `on_tool_policy` binds real dispatch logic
(`packages/motoko-ext-compose/compose.ail:838` → `:83`). The count carries no information about
whether a covered hook carries behaviour, which is the exact distinction the floor was reaching for.
"Disclosure achieves what the floor was for" (ADR:1075) is therefore not supported.

The ADR is entitled to decide that installed-and-fully-excluded is permitted — ADR:1057–1058 already
says so explicitly, and both sixth-pass reviews licensed "restate or delete". What is not supportable
is deleting the gate and then claiming the replacement performs its function.

**Action:** pick one and say it plainly. Either (a) restate the floor in the form that was always
decidable — *not every hook of an installed extension may be excluded, except where classifier 2's
rejection rule forces full exclusion* (this is the old rule plus the old `ai_step` carve-out, and it
is decidable from the profile definition alone); or (b) keep disclosure only, delete the sentence
claiming it achieves the floor's purpose, and move the clause out of the acceptance table into D5 as
a well-formedness obligation on the result — which is where a reporting duty with no gate semantics
belongs, and which is the alternative Claude R10 offered and this pass did not take.

---

### R3. "One predicate, at six sites, in the same words" is false at three sites, and ADR:1114–1116 normatively states the rule the pass retired as actively harmful

**Defect:** the pass wrote (ADR:418–427) that the rule is stated at six named sites in the same words
and that "a seventh saying otherwise is a defect". Two of the six named sites, plus obligation 2's
specification of the inventory the rule consumes, still carry the retired "reference" phrasing — and
one of them states the retired rule as the definition.

**Grounding:**

```
$ grep -n "textual reference\|references\|referencing\|reference inventory\|field-reference" \
    ADR-001-…md   # body only, lines < 1948
1111: invalid is installing an extension that **references** a classifier-2 `ExtPorts` field while any hook
1114: case is exactly this (D1), and obligation 2's classifier 2 supplies the reference inventory. The
1115: predicate is textual reference at **extension** granularity, not "reaches a seam" and not per-hook
1285: `ExtPorts.ai_step` returns `Result[string, string]`. Inventory its field-reference sites across every
1807: `ext_ai_step` reaches the same seam through an ABI that cannot return a successor (D1). A profile
      installing an `ai_step`-referencing extension is conformant only by excluding …
```

- **ADR:1110–1116 is "D5's exclusion paragraph"** — named in the six — and it does not merely use a
  stale word: ADR:1115 says *"The predicate is textual reference at extension granularity"*. That is
  the rule ADR:392–403 spends a paragraph rejecting because, run as a grep, it selects five packages
  including both `motoko-ext-empty-stop-guard` and `motoko-ext-progress-contract-guard` and makes the
  ADR's own interim profile inert. A reader who implements D5 as written builds the wrong gate.
- **ADR:1807 is "Implementation Handoff item 2"** — also named in the six — and says
  "`ai_step`-referencing extension".
- **ADR:1285** specifies the artifact the rule reads: "Inventory its **field-reference sites**". The
  rule is a call predicate; the inventory it consumes is specified as a reference inventory. These
  produce different sets — five packages versus two call sites — which is precisely the discrepancy
  this pass was written to fix.

This is the third consecutive pass to ship this defect class (sixth pass: "stated once", false at two
sites; seventh: "six sites, same words", false at three).

**Action:** edit ADR:1111, 1114–1116, 1285 and 1807 to *calls a classifier-2 field on an
`ExtPorts`-typed value, at extension granularity*, and make ADR:1285 say "call sites". Then state the
count as derived and checkable rather than asserted — the implementation plan should make
`grep -c` over the predicate's canonical phrasing a documentation check, the same disposition the
pass adopted for the review count.

---

### R4. Syntactic dominance does not hold for the ADR's own worked example, and as a textual check it fails open on a negated guard

**Defect:** the new conservative mechanical check requires an attributed site to be "textually
dominated by a guard naming the attributed hook id" and cites `src/core/ext/runtime.ail`'s five
`if is_test_dummy(h.id)` guards as satisfying it. They do not dominate the attributed site, they
dominate its *callers* in a different function; and no guard text contains the hook id.

**Grounding:** the attributed site is `src/core/ext/runtime.ail:190` (ADR:964, 991, 995, 1001):

```
$ sed -n '187,198p' src/core/ext/runtime.ail
187: func emit_dummy_hook(hook: string, key: string, val: string) -> () ! {IO, Clock} {
190:     kv("ts", jnum(intToFloat(now()))),
197: func is_test_dummy(hook_id: string) -> bool {
198:   hook_id == "test_dummy" || startsWith(hook_id, "test_dummy#")
199: }
```

Line 190 sits inside `emit_dummy_hook`, which has no guard. The five guards (`:206, :222, :239,
:280, :368`) dominate the five *calls* to `emit_dummy_hook` (`:206, :222, :245, :287, :374`) — the
ADR states this itself at ADR:995–999. Establishing that they dominate `:190` requires following one
call edge, which is the interprocedural reasoning ADR:971–972 says the clause exists to avoid. So
either the check is interprocedural, in which case it is not "textual" and not "decidable by the same
textual inventory obligation 2 already builds", or it rejects the ADR's only worked attribution.

Second: no guard *names* the hook id. The id is `"test_dummy"`
(`packages/motoko-ext-test-dummy/register.ail:60`); the guard text is `is_test_dummy(h.id)`, whose
match is a substring of a *helper function name*. Substring matching on guard text then admits
`if !is_test_dummy(h.id) then …`, where the site executes exactly when the hook is **not** installed —
a maximally false attribution that passes the check. The ADR claims the check "catches the fabricated
attribution above" (`src/core/rpc.ail:200` → `test_dummy`); it does, but only because that site has no
guard at all. A negated guard is the fabrication the check is supposed to catch and does not.

**Action:** state the check as *the attributed site, or a function that transitively contains it and
is called only from guarded positions, is dominated by a guard whose predicate resolves to an
equality test against the attributed hook id* — and say that resolving the predicate is one call edge
of manual reading, not a grep. Add negation as an explicit disqualifier. If that is too much
machinery for clause 3, drop the check and let ADR:974–975's named-reviewer obligation stand alone;
a mechanical check that its own worked example fails is worse than no mechanical check.

---

### R5. The attribution table is specified as both source-global and recorded in each profile definition, and the reviewer field D4 now requires is absent from D5's list of what a profile records

**Defect:** the new bullet makes the table source-global with profiles intersecting against it, but
the two places that say what a profile *records* were not updated, and still say the profile records
the table itself.

**Grounding:** ADR:960–961 — "**The table is source-global; profiles intersect against it.**" Against:

- ADR:949–951 (Contents and binding): "The table is bound to a source revision and **recorded in the
  versioned profile definition above**".
- ADR:1033–1034 (the profile-definition record): "the **site-to-hook attribution table** (D4 clause
  3) under which its profile-reachable set was computed, bound to the source revision it was derived
  from".

These are different artifacts with different staleness rules: if each profile embeds a copy of a
global table, a correction to the global table requires a version bump on every profile, which is the
opposite of what "source-global" buys. Separately, ADR:974–975 says "the profile definition records a
named reviewer per attribution row", but the enumeration at ADR:1023–1037 lists nine fields and no
reviewer.

The intersection semantics themselves are implementable as stated — a row lists hooks (ADR:949–950),
a profile intersects its installed set against each row (ADR:960–962), and un-attributed sites still
fail closed into clause 1 (ADR:940–944) — so only the record shape is wrong.

**Action:** change ADR:949–951 and ADR:1033–1034 to record a *reference*: the table's identity, its
source-revision binding, and a content hash, so a profile pins which table it computed against without
embedding it. Add the per-row named reviewer to the ADR:1023–1037 enumeration, or move that obligation
to the implementation plan (see the note under R7 on where human-process obligations belong).

---

### R6. The disclosure obligation is specified as named hooks in one place and as counts in two others

**Defect:** ADR:1035–1036 requires the profile definition to record "**which** of its eight ABI hooks
are classified covered and which excluded"; ADR:1072–1073 requires the result to report "covered and
excluded hook **counts**, and the profile definition must record the same"; ADR:1644 requires the
result to report "counts". Names and counts are not the same obligation, and per R2 only the named
form carries any information.

**Grounding:** ADR:1035–1036 vs ADR:1072–1073 vs ADR:1644, quoted above.

**Action:** make all three the named form — per installed extension, the covered hook ids and the
excluded hook ids. That is strictly more informative, costs nothing extra to produce, and is the only
version under which "a profile covering only ABI-pure no-op slots is visible as such" is true.

---

### R7. D5:1124's "deterministic fixture hooks may form the initial profile" is now dead, and was not corrected alongside the guards

**Defect:** the pass correctly narrowed the "pure guards may form the initial profile" line
(ADR:1102–1108: the guards "cover none of their own logic"). The same sentence's other half — fixture
hooks — is dead for the same and an additional reason, and was left unqualified.

**Grounding:** ADR:1124 reads "pure guards and deterministic fixture hooks may form the initial
profile." The repo's only fixture package is `packages/motoko_ext_conformance`, and:

```
$ grep -rn "\.ai_step(" src packages --include=*.ail
packages/motoko-ext-compaction-ai/compaction_ai.ail:106:  match ctx.ports.ai_step(model, prompt_msgs) {
packages/motoko_ext_conformance/fixtures/reject_fixtures.ail:90:  let summary = match ctx.ports.ai_step(ctx.model, msgs) {
```

So the fixture package calls a classifier-2 field, and under the extension-granularity rule every hook
it registers must be excluded — it covers nothing. Its `on_pre_step` is pinned at nine effects
independently (`reject_fixtures.ail:97`). Both halves of ADR:1124 therefore name classes with no
available member.

This also strains ADR:408–410's "if a profile ever installs a fixture package deliberately, the rule
applies to it unchanged" against ADR:1124: the two are compatible only in the sense that the
deliberately-installed fixture package would be inert.

**Action:** qualify ADR:1124 the way ADR:1102–1108 qualifies the guards — name what such a profile
covers (nothing, in the interim) — or delete the clause and let ADR:1102–1108 be the only statement
about what the first interim profile is.

---

### R8. Classifier 1's stdlib-commit check is stated as fail-closed but names no comparand, and the comparand exists

**Defect:** ADR:1240–1241 requires the derivation to record `git -C <scan root> rev-parse HEAD` and
says "a profile whose recorded stdlib commit does not match **the toolchain that ran it** fails
closed." Nothing says how a commit is obtained from the toolchain, which is a binary. The check is
not implementable as written — and it is trivially implementable, because the installer stamps the
commit into the binary.

**Grounding:**

```
$ ailang --version
AILANG v0.26.0
Commit: 3b52a24
Full:   3b52a24d24431c372ed5605289ef039592209514

$ git -C ~/.local/share/ailang rev-parse HEAD
3b52a24d24431c372ed5605289ef039592209514
```

`scripts/install-prerequisites.sh:582-586` sets
`-X …/internal/version.Commit=$(git -C "$ailang_src" rev-parse HEAD)`, and
`.github/workflows/verify-extensions.yml:76` does the same. The ADR's own premise for needing this
check re-derives correctly: `install_ailang` returns at `scripts/install-prerequisites.sh:557-559`
whenever any installed `ailang` satisfies the `>=0.26.0` floor, so the clone need not exist or match,
and `AILANG_REF="v0.26.0"` (`:39`) is a mutable tag.

**Action:** name the comparand — `ailang --version`'s `Full:` field — and state the check as: the
derivation fails closed unless the recorded `rev-parse HEAD` of the scan root equals the executing
compiler's stamped commit.

---

### R9. D1's headline statement of the rule is garbled by the edit that introduced it, at one of the six sites claimed to state it "in the same words"

**Defect:** the sentence at ADR:365–367 is not grammatical and its bold markers nest, so the site the
pass counts among the six does not state the rule at all.

**Grounding:** ADR:365–367 reads:

> … and **every hook that
> an extension **calls** `ExtPorts.ai_step` must be an explicitly excluded hook in any conformant
> interim profile — every hook that extension registers, not only the ones reaching the call.**

The prior revision was "every hook that **can reach** `ExtPorts.ai_step` must be …"; the edit
replaced "can reach" with "an extension calls" without repairing "every hook that", and opened a
second `**` inside an unclosed one.

**Action:** "…and **an extension that calls `ExtPorts.ai_step` must have every hook it registers
explicitly excluded in any conformant interim profile — every hook it registers, not only the ones
reaching the call.**"

---

### R10. Classifier 1's declaration rule does not say where in a signature the effect row may appear, which is the one form I could not rule out

**Defect:** "exported declarations carrying a non-empty effect row", scanned signature-scoped, does
not distinguish the declaration's own row from a higher-order *parameter's* row. On the pin this
changes nothing, but it is a latent instance of exactly the class that has now been corrected three
times.

**Grounding:** the pin has three exported declaration forms and no fourth —

```
$ grep -rhoE "^export [a-z]+" ~/.local/share/ailang/std --include=*.ail | sort | uniq -c
    222 export pure
    182 export func
     38 export type
```

— and no `export type` field carries an effect row, so types are not a hole. The parameter case is
real, though: `std/ai.ail:318-324` declares `stepWithStream(… on_chunk: (StreamChunk) -> () ! {IO}) →
… ! {AI}`, and `std/smoke.ail:40-43` declares `dispatchAllTools(… dispatch: (string) -> () ! {e}) →
() ! {IO | e}`. A signature-scoped union of rows attributes `{IO}` to `stepWithStream`. Both modules
are already in the set for their own rows, so membership is unchanged today; a pure combinator module
taking an effectful callback would be wrongly added, and none exists on the pin.

**Action:** one clause — the row that decides membership is the declaration's **result** row, not a
row appearing in a parameter type. Then the completeness claim is closed against the pin's grammar
rather than against the four defects found so far.

---

## What is accurate

Everything below was re-run from source in this session, not inherited.

**Classifier 2's call-site narrowing is correct and its evidence re-derives exactly.**
`grep -rn "\.ai_step(" src packages --include=*.ail` returns exactly two lines:
`packages/motoko-ext-compaction-ai/compaction_ai.ail:106` and
`packages/motoko_ext_conformance/fixtures/reject_fixtures.ail:90`. The textual grep does select five
packages — `motoko-ext-abi`, `motoko-ext-compaction-ai`, `motoko_ext_conformance`,
`motoko-ext-empty-stop-guard`, `motoko-ext-progress-contract-guard` — and the two guards match on
exactly the scaffolding the ADR names: `noop_ai_step` stubs at `empty_stop_guard.ail:52,53` and
`progress_contract_guard.ail:136,137`, and `ai_step: noop_ai_step` constructions at `:70` and `:154`.
`motoko_ext_conformance` is indeed non-registrable: `src/core/ext/registry_generated.ail` names
sixteen packages and it is not among them. The out-of-scope list (declarations, record construction,
strings/comments, `motoko-ext-abi`) is consistent with what `\.ai_step(` actually matches — `src/core/
session.ail`'s four occurrences and `src/core/ext/ctx_defaults.ail`'s three are all names,
constructions, or the wrapper definition, and none match.

**A2 — the corrected extension-coverage claim is right this time, on the ABI.** Checked against
`packages/motoko-ext-abi/types.ail:151-165`, not against the correction's prose: five slots
excludable-only (`on_pre_step`, `on_tool_handle`, `on_response_intercept`, `on_solver_candidate` at
nine effects; `on_budget_plan` at `! {Env, FS}`), three rowless and coverable. The four cited
extensions do put real logic in `on_tool_policy` — `compose.ail:838` binds
`on_tool_policy_with_mode(composition_mode, …)` (`:83`), `microrag/register.ail:189` binds
`microrag_tool_policy`, and `context_mode.ail:80` / `omnigraph.ail:69` bind real dispatch predicates,
all rowless and therefore genuinely coverable. The narrow surviving claim also holds: both guards'
`decide` is reached through `on_solver_candidate`, pinned at nine effects, so the pair covers none of
its own logic. The `compaction_ai` arithmetic is exact — `register.ail:100-109` gives three rowless
slots, `on_budget_plan ! {Env, FS}`, and three at nine, i.e. four of seven trivial hooks classify
effectful. **The edges are where it still fails: R1 (the same over-generalisation surviving at
ADR:1067) and a live equivocation between hook-coverage and extension-coverage** — ADR:1046–1051
defines an extension as covered only when *every* reachable hook qualifies, and ADR:1053 says an
excluded hook still fails closed "if dispatch reaches it", so no extension can be covered in the
interim at all; ADR:1036's justification ("cannot present itself as covering the extension") describes
something already impossible.

**A6 — classifier 1's declaration pattern is complete against the pin, with the one gap at R10.** All
four defects re-derived independently:

- `grep -cE '^export func .*! \{[A-Za-z]' ~/.local/share/ailang/std/process.ail` → **0**; `exec`'s row
  is at `process.ail:62`, three lines below the `export func` at `:59`.
- The "sixteen" is **exact**: parsing signatures rather than lines gives ai 6 (`ai.ail:168,177,191,213,
  318,346`), net 2 (`:130,173`), process 4 (`:59,84,95,105`), smoke 2 (`:40,59`), zip 2 (`:52,62`) =
  16, with `std/ai/streaming.ail`'s three (`:100,113,149`) correctly accounted separately under the
  recursive-glob bullet.
- `std/list.ail` has exactly the five named `! {e}` exports (`:193,204,215,226,237`) and no other row,
  so the effect-variable rule drops it. The rule's phrasing — "rows whose *every* element is a
  lower-case effect variable" — is right rather than merely adequate: it keeps `std/smoke`, whose
  `dispatchAllTools` returns `! {IO | e}` (`smoke.ail:43`).
- `std/ai/streaming.ail` has six effectful exports (three `! {AI, Stream, Net}`, three `! {Stream}` —
  the ADR's "six `! {Stream}` exports" is loose but every row does carry `Stream`), `std/ai` is a
  builtin-projection member and `std/ai/streaming` is not (21 modules from
  `ailang builtins list -json`, enumerated), and no `.ail` file under `src` or `packages` imports it.
  `std/ai` is the only subdirectory under `std/`, so `std/**` closes the recursion.
- `export pure func … ! {Declassify}` is accepted on the pin at
  `~/.local/share/ailang/examples/runnable/contracts/inbox_injection_v2.ail:39`. No `export pure func`
  in `std/` carries a non-empty row today, so this repair is defensive rather than set-changing — worth
  saying, since the ADR presents all four as equally load-bearing.

I looked for a sixth form and found none in the grammar: `export pure`, `export func`, `export type`
are the only exported declaration keywords in the pinned stdlib, and no `export type` field carries a
row. The signature-position ambiguity at R10 is the only opening left.

**A1 — explicit ruling: no, the replacement clause cannot fail on coverage state.** It is a reporting
obligation and fails only if the result omits the counts. A profile installing fourteen extensions
and covering nothing now passes the row it previously failed, having disclosed that it covers nothing
— and per R2 the disclosed counts do not even distinguish it from an honest profile. The pass's own
argument against a structural rule ("a structural rule over a field set the extension does not
control cannot" work) does **not** argue against the replacement, so it is not self-defeating; it is
simply not an argument that disclosure is sufficient. Disclosure is the right *content*; the
acceptance table is the wrong *home* for it.

**Anchors: no error, for the second consecutive pass.** Every anchor introduced or changed in this
pass is exact — `types.ail:151-165` and each hook row; `types.ail:63`; `empty_stop_guard.ail:52,53,70`;
`progress_contract_guard.ail:136,137,154`; `compose.ail:838`; `microrag/register.ail:189`;
`compaction_ai.ail:106`; `reject_fixtures.ail:90`; `session.ail:662` and `ext_ports_of` at `:668-677`;
`runtime.ail:190`, the five calls at `:206,222,245,287,374` and five guards at `:206,222,239,280,368`;
`std/process.ail`, `std/list.ail`, `std/ai/streaming.ail`; `inbox_injection_v2.ail:39`;
`install-prerequisites.sh` early return at `:557-559`. I also spot-checked unchanged neighbours that
the changed text leans on — `std/sem.ail:374,385`, `std/extension.ail:27`,
`motoko-ext-omnigraph/register.ail:4` — all exact.

**Status block: the count is right and derived correctly.** Fifteen sections at both `a3519d6` and
`5fa0bea`; `(15 − 5) = 10`; "ten independent delta reviews (two each of the second through sixth
correction passes)" checks out, as does the 2026-08-01/2026-08-02 date range. Grounding also still
holds: `git diff --stat 99749c7d..HEAD -- src packages scripts Makefile .github` is empty, so no
source has moved under the ADR since the last re-grounding. **The stale content in this block is
ADR:41 — "The rule is stated at six sites in the same words" — which is R3**, i.e. the class that
survived last time survived again, in the same paragraph that warns about it.

**The pre/post-table framing is arithmetically sound.** 4 core + 8 `compose` + 1 `test_dummy` = 13;
moving `runtime.ail:190` to unconditional core pre-table gives 5 / 13 / 13 and collapses the
twelve-versus-thirteen distinction, exactly as ADR:860–863 and ADR:992–993 state. I did not reopen
the count of 13 or "nothing is routed at HEAD".

## Recommended pre-acceptance actions

**This ADR must fix, in dependency order:**

1. **R1** — correct ADR:1067–1069 to the ABI enumeration. Everything about the floor's disposition
   depends on getting this premise right, and it is the same claim the previous commit retracted.
2. **R2** — having corrected the premise, choose and state the disposition: restate the floor with its
   classifier-2 carve-out, or keep disclosure alone, delete "Disclosure achieves what the floor was
   for", and relocate the clause from the acceptance table to D5 as a result well-formedness
   obligation. Then **R6** — make the disclosure named rather than counted at all three sites.
3. **R3 and R9** — bring ADR:1111, 1114–1116, 1285, 1807 and 365–367 to the single phrasing, and state
   the site count as a derived, greppable check rather than an assertion.
4. **R4** — restate or drop syntactic dominance. Do not ship a mechanical check whose only worked
   example fails it.
5. **R5** — split the table from the profile's reference to it; add or relocate the reviewer field.
6. **R7, R8, R10** — the three single-clause repairs.

**Belongs to the implementation plan, not this ADR:** the per-row named-reviewer obligation is the
first human-process requirement this document imposes, and it is better expressed as a schema field
here (*the profile definition carries a reviewer per attribution row*) with the review procedure in
the plan; the `grep`-based documentation checks for the review count and the predicate phrasing;
building both classifiers and the attribution producer in one source-revision-bound change; wiring
profile-load validation into CI; and the declared-versus-performed successor detector, without which
the five pinned hook slots stay excludable-only.

---

## Accept / revise

**Revise.** Classifier 1's scan repairs, classifier 2's call-site narrowing, the pre/post-table
framing, and every anchor hold; the floor's deletion argument, the six-sites claim, and syntactic
dominance do not. **The upstream API blocker is unchanged and remains fully in force: acceptance
still requires the recorded-stream API in an actual AILANG release, this repository repinned to it,
and the positive integration probe passing. `arniwesth/ailang`'s `stepWithStreamRecorded` on the
`v0.31.0` tag is a prototype and clears none of those three conditions.** Nothing in this pass or
this review moves that blocker.

---

## Review Comments

**Reviewer:** independent delta review of the **seventh correction pass**, re-derived from the
committed source and toolchain after preserving the preceding Claude review verbatim.
**Model:** `GPT-5 Codex`.
**Date:** 2026-08-02.
**Reviewed at:** `5fa0beaa824822671573e860e41506e234da0aa9`, covering
`d6904c4..5fa0bea` — correction commit `a3519d6` plus follow-up `5fa0bea`.
**Section count:** the commit reviewed has **15** sections at both commits in the correction range:
`git show a3519d6:.agent/projects/009_motoko_dst_execution/ADR-001-deterministic-test-world-architecture.md | grep -c '^## Review Comments'`
and the same command with `HEAD` each return `15`; `(15 − 5) = 10`, matching the Status block. The
preserved Claude section is the sixteenth working-tree section, so this separately appended review is
the **seventeenth**.
**Toolchain:** `AILANG v0.26.0`; `ailang --version` reports full commit
`3b52a24d24431c372ed5605289ef039592209514`, equal to
`git -C ~/.local/share/ailang rev-parse HEAD`.
**Verdict: Revise.** The five-excludable/three-coverable ABI enumeration, the two present
classifier-2 calls, the four concrete classifier-1 repairs, the pre/post-table arithmetic, the Status
count, and all changed line locations re-derive. The replacement for the floor is not a coverage
gate; the global-table and dominance rules are not mechanically coherent; the typed classifier-2
predicate is neither consistently stated nor implementable by its promised grep; and classifier 1's
textual alternative remains underspecified.

---

### R1. The replacement for the coverage floor cannot fail on coverage state, so it does not perform the rejection function the ADR says it replaces

**Defect:** the old floor rejected an installed extension with zero covered hooks, while the new
acceptance clause passes any coverage state, including `0 covered / 8 excluded`, as long as counts are
reported.

**Grounding:**
`git show d6904c4:.agent/projects/009_motoko_dst_execution/ADR-001-deterministic-test-world-architecture.md | nl -ba | sed -n '990,1000p'`
shows the deleted predicate at `:995-996`: "a conformant profile must cover at least one hook of
every extension it installs". At `HEAD`, ADR:1057-1058 expressly permits an installed, fully excluded
extension; ADR:1072-1077 requires only reporting; and the automated acceptance row at ADR:1644 says
only that the result reports counts. No clause compares either count with a threshold.

Counts do make `0/8` visible, so they distinguish it from `3/5`; they simply do not reject it. Counts
also cannot distinguish two `3/5` cases whose rowless slots have different semantics:
`compaction_ai`'s three are constant returns (`register.ail:100,101,106`), whereas `compose` binds real
rowless policy logic (`compose.ail:838` to `:83`). Named hook ids and source attribution can expose
that distinction; counts alone cannot.

**Action:** decide explicitly whether full exclusion is permitted. If yes, delete "Disclosure
achieves what the floor was for" and specify disclosure as profile/manifest/result well-formedness
evidence, not a coverage predicate. If no, add a predicate with an explicit classifier-2 exception.
If the intended floor is behavioural rather than merely structural, make it extension-specific and
name the behavioural hooks; the former one-hook rule cannot express that distinction.

---

### R2. The source-global attribution table is still defined in profile-relative terms, so the empty-intersection case has two incompatible outcomes

**Defect:** the new global-table bullet makes a site unreachable when its row has no hook installed by
the profile, but the unchanged mechanical rule instead sends that same site to unconditional core.

**Grounding:** ADR:960-967 says the table is source-global, keyed on **known** hook identities, and
profiles intersect each row with what they install. Against that:

- ADR:940-944 says every core site is attributed to one or more **installed** hooks or is
  unconditional core. For the `runtime.ail:190 -> test_dummy` row in a profile without `test_dummy`,
  the intersection is empty; this wording therefore finds no installed attribution and defaults the
  site to core, contradicting ADR:960-967.
- ADR:949-952 says a row records the **installed** hooks and that the table itself is recorded in a
  versioned profile.
- ADR:1033-1034 again makes the table, rather than a reference to it, a profile field.
- ADR:974-975 puts a reviewer "per attribution row" in the profile even though the row is now part of
  the global artifact.

The fail-closed rule at ADR:968-978 is otherwise sound: unknown ids, stale binding, malformed rows,
and un-attributed sites fail closed. What is missing is one unambiguous rule for a valid row whose
intersection is empty.

**Action:** define one source-global artifact whose rows name known hook identities and carry their
reviewer; define profile reachability as `row.hooks ∩ profile.installed_hooks != ∅`; state that only a
missing/invalid row falls back to unconditional core; and make the profile record a versioned
reference containing at least table identity, source commit, and content hash rather than embedding a
second table.

---

### R3. Syntactic dominance is neither the textual check claimed nor a conservative test of necessity

**Defect:** the ADR's only worked attribution fails the stated local dominance rule, and a guard that
merely names the right hook can pass while proving the opposite of necessity.

**Grounding:** ADR:980-985 requires the attributed site to be "textually dominated by a guard naming
the attributed hook id" and cites five `is_test_dummy` guards. The attributed effect site is
`src/core/ext/runtime.ail:190`, inside `emit_dummy_hook` at `:187-195`; no guard is in that function.
The guards are at `:206,222,239,280,368` and dominate calls to `emit_dummy_hook` at
`:206,222,245,287,374`. Relating those callers to `:190` follows a call edge, so it is interprocedural,
not a textual dominance check over the site. The guard text also does not name the hook id; the
literal comparison is inside `is_test_dummy` at `:197-199`. A textual rule that accepts the helper
name also accepts `if not is_test_dummy(h.id)`, where `test_dummy` is not necessary.

**Action:** either drop the claimed mechanical proof and rely on the named manual review, or specify
an interprocedural check that resolves the guard predicate to a positive installed-id test, proves all
calls to the containing function are dominated by it, and rejects negation and alternative unguarded
calls. Keep the reviewer as table-row schema in the ADR; put reviewer workflow in the implementation
plan.

---

### R4. Classifier 2's typed-call predicate is neither stated consistently nor decidable by the one grep said to implement it

**Defect:** normative sites still specify textual reference, and `\.ai_step\(` cannot establish that
the receiver is `ExtPorts` or discover the indirect calls the ADR says must fail closed.

**Grounding:** the committed body still says "references" at ADR:1111, "reference inventory" at
ADR:1114, "textual reference" at ADR:1115, "field-reference sites" at ADR:1285, and
"`ai_step`-referencing extension" at ADR:1807.

ADR:365-367 is additionally malformed: "every hook that an extension **calls**
`ExtPorts.ai_step`" nests bold markers and is not grammatical. The actual call scan is:

```
$ rg -n '\.ai_step\(' src packages --glob '*.ail'
packages/motoko_ext_conformance/fixtures/reject_fixtures.ail:90:  let summary = match ctx.ports.ai_step(ctx.model, msgs) {
packages/motoko-ext-compaction-ai/compaction_ai.ail:106:  match ctx.ports.ai_step(model, prompt_msgs) {
```

Both current receivers are `ExtPorts` through `ExtCtx.ports` (`types.ail:78-98`). But the regex also
matches an unrelated record's `ai_step` call (fail-closed false positive), while a local alias,
wrapper, re-export, computed access, or whitespace/newline before `(` can hide an `ExtPorts` call
(fail-open false negative). ADR:1302-1310 calls unresolved indirect access a manual-triage candidate,
but the grep provides no inventory that discovers that candidate.

**Action:** canonicalise ADR:365-367, 1111-1116, 1285 and 1807 to the typed-call rule. Replace the
"one grep" claim with a parsed/type-aware field-call inventory, or define a two-stage conservative
scan that inventories every `ai_step` occurrence, strips declarations/construction/strings/comments,
proves receiver types, and fails closed on every unresolved alias, wrapper, re-export, or computed
access.

---

### R5. The false behavioural-hook generalisation corrected by `5fa0bea` still supports the floor-deletion argument three paragraphs earlier

**Defect:** ADR:1067-1070 still says every behavioural hook has the full nine-effect row and no
behaviour-carrying hook is coverable, contradicting both the ABI and the corrected enumeration at
ADR:1089-1100.

**Grounding:** `nl -ba packages/motoko-ext-abi/types.ail | sed -n '151,165p'` returns three rowless
slots (`on_describe_tools`, `on_build_system_prompt`, `on_tool_policy`), `on_budget_plan ! {Env, FS}`,
and four nine-effect slots. Thus `on_budget_plan` is not at nine effects, and rowless
`on_tool_policy` carries real behaviour in `compose`, `context_mode`, and `omnigraph`. The later
five-excludable/three-coverable text is the correct statement.

**Action:** replace ADR:1067-1070 with the exact five/three enumeration and re-adjudicate the deletion
argument without the false "unsatisfiable for any extension that does something" premise.

---

### R6. The microrag anchor resolves, but it does not support the claim that microrag carries real rowless policy logic

**Defect:** ADR:1096-1099 cites `motoko-ext-microrag/register.ail:189` as a real `on_tool_policy`
example, but that binding is a constant no-op.

**Grounding:** `register.ail:189` binds `microrag_tool_policy`; its definition at `:153-155` is:

```
pure func microrag_tool_policy(_ctx: ExtCtx, _call: ToolCallEnvelope) -> ToolPolicyDecision {
  NoOpinion
}
```

The broad "several extensions" claim still holds: `compose.ail:83-90`,
`context_mode.ail:80-84`, and `omnigraph.ail:69-76` contain genuine decisions.

**Action:** remove microrag from the real-logic examples or identify it explicitly as a rowless no-op;
retain the three examples that actually branch on the call/context.

---

### R7. Per-extension disclosure is specified as named hook sets in the profile and as counts in the result

**Defect:** the pass defines two non-equivalent disclosure artifacts while claiming they are "the
same".

**Grounding:** ADR:1035-1037 requires the profile to record **which** hook ids are covered and
excluded. ADR:1072-1073 says the run result reports covered/excluded **counts** and the profile records
"the same"; ADR:1644 also requires only counts. A count cannot establish the acceptance row's claim
that coverage is limited to ABI-pure no-op slots; the named ids can.

**Action:** require named covered/excluded hook-id sets per installed extension in both profile and
result, optionally with derived counts. Keep the identities authoritative and validate that the two
sets are disjoint and exhaust all eight ABI slots.

---

### R8. Classifier 1 is complete through the parsed-interface path, but not through the allowed signature-normalised textual path

**Defect:** a signature-wide textual row match can mistake a higher-order parameter's effect for the
exported function's own effect because the ADR never says to select the outer result row.

**Grounding:** `std/ai.ail:318-324` contains `stepWithStream`, whose callback parameter is
`(StreamChunk) -> () ! {IO}` while the declaration's result row is `! {AI}`. Executing:

```
$ ailang iface ~/.local/share/ailang/std/ai.ail 2>/dev/null |
    jq -c '.funcs[] | select(.name=="stepWithStream") | {name,type,effects}'
{"name":"stepWithStream","type":"(string,list[Message],list[ToolSchema],list[CacheBreakpoint],(StreamChunk)->()!{IO})->Result[<*types.TRecord2>,<*types.TRecord2>]!{AI}","effects":["AI"]}
```

shows the parsed interface distinguishes them correctly. The same interface reports empty concrete
effects for `std/list`'s five `! {e}` exports. The pinned stdlib uses 182 `export func`, 222
`export pure func`, and 38 `export type` declarations, with no standalone export list and no exported
type field carrying an effect row; I found no additional active declaration form on the pin.

The recursive example's exact wording is also off: `std/ai/streaming.ail` has six effectful exports
whose rows contain `Stream`, but three are `! {AI, Stream, Net}` and three are `! {Stream}`, not six
literal `! {Stream}` exports. Membership is unaffected.

**Action:** make parsed interfaces (for example `ailang iface`) the normative source-half scanner, or
define signature normalisation to read only each exported function's outer result row. Say "six
exports whose rows contain `Stream`". In the implementation plan, use an actual recursive walk (or
enable Bash `globstar`): with default Bash settings, literal `std/**/*.ail` matched only
`std/ai/streaming.ail` here and omitted all 43 top-level files.

---

### R9. The initial-profile fixture statement does not identify a usable current fixture path

**Defect:** D5 says deterministic fixture hooks may form the initial profile, but the only current
fixture package is non-registrable and the extension-granularity classifier excludes all of its hooks
when that package is deliberately installed.

**Grounding:** `rg -n '\.ai_step\(' packages/motoko_ext_conformance --glob '*.ail'` returns
`fixtures/reject_fixtures.ail:90`; the same file exports three `ExtensionHooks` constructors at
`:112-122`. The package is absent from `src/core/ext/registry_generated.ail`, whose fifteen
registrable extension imports are at `:7-21`. ADR:408-410 nevertheless says the rule applies
unchanged if a profile deliberately installs a fixture package, while ADR:1124 says fixture hooks may
form the initial profile. Under package/extension granularity, the call at `:90` forces full exclusion
for the deliberately installed package.

**Action:** either mark ADR:1124 as future-only, or specify a deliberate fixture-loading mechanism and
the unit of classifier granularity so a non-calling fixture hook can be selected without laundering a
calling sibling in the same package. Do not present the current package as a covering initial profile.

---

## What is accurate

Everything below was re-run against `5fa0bea` and the pinned toolchain.

**A1 — explicit ruling: no, the replacement cannot fail on coverage state.** It can fail only as a
schema/presence check when disclosure is absent. Visible-but-permitted full exclusion is a coherent
authoring choice, and ADR:1057-1058 now makes that choice, but it is not the anti-laundering rejection
the deleted floor performed. Disclosure can remain acceptance evidence for boundary honesty only if
the ADR labels its semantics accurately.

**A2 — explicit ruling: the corrected ABI enumeration is right this time, with two body defects.**
`types.ail:151-165` gives five excludable-only slots (four at nine effects and `on_budget_plan` at
`{Env, FS}`) and three rowless, coverable slots. Each guard's registered `decide` behaviour is bound
through `on_solver_candidate`
(`packages/motoko-ext-{empty-stop,progress-contract}-guard/register.ail:34-35`), so the named interim
pair covers none of its own guard logic. The edges that fail are R5's surviving opposite claim and
R6's microrag example; three other real `on_tool_policy` examples remain.

**A6 — explicit ruling: the four repairs produce the correct source-derived set on the pin, but the
declaration pattern is not complete for both implementations the ADR permits.** Re-run results:

- `grep -cE '^export func .*! \{[A-Za-z]' ~/.local/share/ailang/std/process.ail` -> `0`, while
  `exec`'s outer row is at `:62`; signature scoping recovers it.
- The five `std/list` exports at `:193,204,215,226,237` contain only variable row `{e}` and parsed
  interfaces report no concrete effects for them.
- `ailang check ~/.local/share/ailang/examples/runnable/contracts/inbox_injection_v2.ail` succeeds;
  its `export pure func ... ! {Declassify}` is at `:39`.
- A parsed-interface walk of all 44 recursive `std` files finds six effectful exports in
  `std/ai/streaming.ail`, and no file fails interface generation.

The parsed-interface path correctly handles the remaining outer-row ambiguity; the textual
signature alternative needs R8's repair. The resolved-commit binding is stated as fail-closed, not
merely recorded. `scripts/install-prerequisites.sh:556-559` does return early for any installed
version satisfying `>=0.26.0`; the exact comparison should read the compiler's `Full:` commit in the
implementation plan.

**Classifier 2's current inventory is exact.** `rg -n '\.ai_step\(' src packages --glob '*.ail'`
returns the two calls quoted in R4. `rg -l '\bai_step\b' packages --glob '*.ail' | cut -d/ -f2 |
sort -u` returns five packages: ABI, compaction-ai, conformance fixtures, empty-stop guard, and
progress-contract guard. The guards match only declaration/string/construction scaffolding at
`empty_stop_guard.ail:52,53,70` and `progress_contract_guard.ail:136,137,154`, not calls.
`motoko_ext_conformance` is absent from the generated registry. The current two call receivers are
both `ExtPorts`; R4 is about the matcher boundary, not a missed HEAD call.

**The source-global intersection intent and fail-closed default are directionally correct.** A valid
row lists hook identities; a profile should consider its site reachable exactly when the installed
intersection is non-empty; unknown ids, stale/malformed rows, and missing attribution fail closed.
R2 is the unreconciled normative wording and artifact ownership, not rejection of that model.

**Changed locations resolve, but one semantic anchor does not support its prose.** Re-checked:
`types.ail:63,151-165`; both guard triples; `compose.ail:838`; `microrag/register.ail:189`;
`compaction_ai.ail:106`; `reject_fixtures.ail:90`; `runtime.ail:190` plus its five calls and guards;
the three stdlib files; `inbox_injection_v2.ail:39`; and the installer early return. All line
locations are exact. R6 is a content failure at an exact location, not an off-by-line anchor.

**The Status review count is correct; its content is stale at the classifier claim.** Both reviewed
commits have fifteen sections, so `(15 − 5) = 10` delta reviews. The dates and "two each of the second
through sixth correction passes" also hold. ADR:41-50's "six sites, same words" assertion is the stale
content identified in R4. I did not reopen the settled count of 13, routing-at-HEAD state, or the
pre/post-table arithmetic; the new `5 / 13 / 13` pre-table and `4 / 12 / 13` post-table framing is
arithmetically sound.

---

## Recommended pre-acceptance actions

**This ADR must fix, in dependency order:**

1. **R1, R5, R6 and R7:** correct the ABI premise and microrag example, then explicitly adjudicate
   visible-but-permitted versus rejected full exclusion. Make named hook sets the authoritative
   disclosure in profile and result.
2. **R8:** choose parsed interfaces or fully specify the outer-result-row textual scan; correct the
   six-`Stream` wording. This stabilises classifier 1 before any profile is evaluated.
3. **R4 and R9:** define a type-aware classifier-2 inventory, canonicalise every rule site, repair the
   malformed D1 sentence, and state whether/how deliberately loaded fixtures participate.
4. **R2 and R3:** define the global table and profile reference, the empty-intersection rule, and the
   row-level reviewer; then replace or withdraw syntactic dominance. No D4/D5 gate may cite the table
   before those semantics are coherent.

**Belongs to the implementation plan:** implement both classifiers from the same resolved source and
toolchain commits; use a recursive walk that includes root and nested stdlib files; compare the scan
root commit with `ailang --version`'s `Full:` value; define the reviewer workflow while keeping the
reviewer field in the ADR's table schema; generate and validate the global attribution artifact and
profile reference; wire profile-load validation and documentation consistency checks into CI; and
retain the declared-versus-performed successor detector as the later route to coverage of the five
pinned hook slots.

---

## Accept / revise

**Revise. The upstream API blocker remains fully in force and unchanged: acceptance still requires a
recorded-stream API in an actual AILANG release, this repository repinned to that release, and the
positive integration probe passing. `arniwesth/ailang`'s `stepWithStreamRecorded` on the `v0.31.0`
tag remains a prototype and clears none of those conditions.**

---

## Review Comments

**Delta review of the eighth correction pass** — reviewed at `39e9b8d`, model `claude-opus-5`,
2026-08-02. Baseline `1cc1084`. This is the **eighteenth** `## Review Comments` section; there were
seventeen at the reviewed commit (`grep -c '^## Review Comments'` → 17), and the ADR body is
unchanged between `39e9b8d` and `ac35443`.

Scope: the single commit `1cc1084..39e9b8d`. The architecture, the accepted 007 decisions, and the
decision to request an upstream API are not reopened.

**Verdict: Revise.** The pass's substantive rulings are right and most of its new text is correct and
well-grounded. What it did not do is finish propagating them: five passages that the restored floor,
the retracted satisfiability claim, and the retired "pure guards" formulation each contradict were
left standing, three of them inside the very passages this pass rewrote. Separately, one load-bearing
premise that this pass newly leaned on — that a rowless ABI row bounds what a hook can perform — is
**false on the pinned toolchain**, which both settles the handoff's headline question and opens a
fail-open larger than the one clause 3 was rewritten to close.

---

### R1. A rowless ABI row does not bound what a hook performs, so "the three rowless slots are coverable" is fail-open — and the proposed narrowing to non-rowless hooks must be rejected

The pass makes `on_describe_tools`, `on_build_system_prompt` and `on_tool_policy` **coverable**
because they "carry no row at all" (body `:1104-1110`, `:1155-1157`), and this pass makes that claim
load-bearing in two new places: it is the sole ground on which the restored floor is satisfiable
(`:1109-1116`), and it is the basis of the `compaction_ai`-versus-`compose` comparison that justifies
named disclosure (`:1128-1133`). Under the declared-row rule, a covered rowless hook is asserted to be
effect-free.

The pinned effect checker does not enforce that for calls through a **function-valued record field**,
which is exactly the shape of `ExtCtx.ports: ExtPorts` (`packages/motoko-ext-abi/types.ail:62-67`,
`:97`):

```text
$ cat a1probe3/main.ail
module a1probe3/main
import std/io (println)
type Ports = { ai_step: (string) -> string ! {IO} }
func rowless_hook(p: Ports) -> string {            -- no effect row
  p.ai_step("called from a rowless hook")
}
export func main() -> () ! {IO} {
  let ports = { ai_step: \s. { let _ = println("EFFECT PERFORMED: ${s}"); "ok" } };
  let r = rowless_hook(ports);
  println("hook returned: ${r}")
}

$ ailang check a1probe3/main.ail
→ Effect checking...
✓ No errors found!

$ ailang run --entry main --caps IO a1probe3/main.ail
EFFECT PERFORMED: called from a rowless hook
hook returned: ok
```

The effect is declared nowhere on `rowless_hook`, the checker accepts it, and the runtime performs it.
The checker *is* transitive through named helpers — the same rowless function calling a
`! {IO}` helper fails with `Missing effects: IO` — and it *is* correct for a direct builtin call,
which is the probe the handoff cites. The gap is specific to field calls, and field calls are the only
way an extension reaches `ExtPorts` at all.

Two consequences.

**(a) The handoff's proposed narrowing is rejected, and the carve-out survives with a member.** The
narrowing rests on "a hook whose ABI row is empty *cannot* reach `ai_step` — not 'is unlikely to',
cannot, by type." That premise is false on the pin: a rowless slot bound to a lambda that calls
`ctx.ports.ai_step` type-checks. So the coarse every-hook rejection rule stands, `compaction_ai`
covers zero hooks, the classifier-2 carve-out has exactly one member today, and the floor-plus-carve-out
machinery introduced by this pass is live text rather than dead. The disposition this pass chose is
the right one.

But the ADR reaches it by the wrong argument. It justifies extension granularity **solely** on
decidability ("nothing maps a call site to the hooks that can reach it"), and decidability alone does
not distinguish the coarse rule from the ABI-row narrowing — the narrowing is equally decidable, read
off the same artifact classifier 2 already reads. That is why this disposition has now moved three
times in three passes. The argument that actually settles it is the probe above: a declared row is not
evidence about performed effects for field-mediated calls, so a rowless row licenses no narrowing.
Record that, or a ninth pass re-proposes the narrowing on the same decidability grounds.

**(b) The coverability of the three rowless slots is an assumption, not a consequence.** The ADR
presents it as following from the closed record. It does not. The only backstop the ADR offers is the
hermeticity probe at `:1184-1186` — "Direct `AI`, `Process`, `Net`, `FS`, `SharedMem`, `Clock`,
environment, or random effects from a reached hook fail the profile's hermeticity probe" — which is a
*runtime* check that fires only if a seed exercises the path, and whose word "direct" arguably exempts
the port-mediated case entirely. That is weaker than the declared-row rule implies.

**Action:** in the `Per-hook classification reads *declared* effect rows` passage, state that on the
pin a declared row bounds performed effects only for direct and named-helper calls, not for calls
through function-valued record fields, with the probe above as evidence; state that rowless-slot
coverability is therefore an assumption backed by the hermeticity probe rather than by the type
system; and rewrite the extension-granularity justification so it rests on that fact rather than on
decidability alone. Then either narrow "direct … effects" in the hermeticity clause so port-mediated
effects from a *covered* hook are also caught, or say explicitly that they are not.

---

### R2. The heading of the floor passage still asserts the position the passage below it reverses

`:1099` opens the passage with:

> **The anti-laundering mechanism is disclosure, not a structural floor.**

Twenty lines later the same passage says the opposite (`:1116-1128`): "**Two mechanisms are needed,
because one rejects and the other informs** … **The floor is restored, in the form that was always
decidable.**" A reader who takes the bolded topic sentence as the passage's claim — which is what a
bolded topic sentence is for — gets the seventh pass's position, not this one's.

```text
$ grep -n "anti-laundering" body8.md
1099:**The anti-laundering mechanism is disclosure, not a structural floor.** An earlier revision required
```

**Action:** rewrite `:1099` to introduce the two-mechanism result, e.g. "**Anti-laundering needs two
mechanisms, and an earlier revision required only a structural floor.**"

---

### R3. Implementation Handoff item 2 still denies the carve-out this pass created, in the passage describing the carve-out's only member

`:1897-1900`:

> A profile installing an `ai_step`-calling extension is conformant only by excluding **every hook
> that extension registers** … Such a profile covers none of that extension's hooks, **which the
> per-extension hook disclosure records rather than a floor exempting it.**

Under `:1124-1128` that is now exactly backwards: a zero-coverage extension is a profile-definition
rejection *unless* the floor exempts it via a recorded classifier-2 carve-out, and the acceptance row
at `:1734` requires that carve-out. This passage is about `compaction_ai`, which is the carve-out's
only member today, so the sentence denies the mechanism precisely where it applies.

**Action:** replace the trailing clause with the current rule — the profile records a classifier-2
carve-out naming the extension and the field, and discloses the covered/excluded hook ids.

---

### R4. The pass retracts "unsatisfiable" and leaves the sentence asserting it thirteen lines above

`:1100-1101` still reads "**That rule is simultaneously vacuous and unsatisfiable**", and `:1113`
now reads "**The floor was therefore satisfiable**".

```text
$ grep -n "vacuous" body8.md
1100:"at least one covered hook per installed extension". **That rule is simultaneously vacuous and
$ sed -n '1113p' body8.md
`on_tool_policy` today. **The floor was therefore satisfiable**, and a correction pass that retracted
```

The retraction paragraph diagnoses this failure mode by name — "a correction pass that retracted this
claim elsewhere left it standing here, where it was doing the work" — and then reproduces it in the
same edit.

**Action:** change `:1100` to "vacuous" alone and drop "and unsatisfiable".

---

### R5. The "same words" warrant the pass removed survives at two of the four places it appears, including three lines below the text that retracts it

The pass correctly dropped "in the same words" from the Status block's rule statement (`:48`) and from
the D1 paragraph's opening (`:428`), and added "**That count is a claim to check, not a warrant**".
Both paragraphs then re-assert it in their closing sentences:

```text
$ grep -n "same words" body8.md
50:retired. The honest claim is the one above — six sites, same words — and a reader who finds a seventh
429:  sites, the seventh asserted "six sites, same words" and was stale at three, one of which stated the
439:  once" and it was stale at two sites; the claim here is checkable — six sites, same words — and a
```

`:429` is the legitimate historical citation. `:50` and `:439` are live re-assertions, and `:439` sits
eleven lines below `:428`'s "not a warrant" inside one paragraph — which also now states the
sixth-pass staleness twice (`:428-429` and `:439`).

"Same words" is also false. The six enumerated sites use six phrasings: `:43-45` "must have **every
hook it registers** excluded"; `:437-438` "**calls a classifier-2 field on an `ExtPorts`-typed
value**, at extension granularity"; `:1848-1850` "conformant only by excluding every hook that
extension registers"; `:1173-1175` "while any hook it registers is **not** excluded"; `:1734` "while
registering an un-excluded hook"; `:1897-1899` "excluding **every hook that extension registers**".
The substance is consistent at all six — that part is genuinely fixed, and D5's normative statement of
the retired rule is gone. Only the "same words" claim is wrong. The count is also generous: D1 states
the rule normatively twice more, at `:366-368` and `:381-383`, outside "this paragraph".

**Action:** delete the clause "— six sites, same words —" at `:50` and `:439`, leaving the count claim
and the "treat a site saying anything else as the defect" instruction; and either fold `:366-368` and
`:381-383` into the enumeration or say the count covers normative statements outside D1's own
derivation.

---

### R6. D1 cites approvingly the "pure guards and deterministic fixture hooks" formulation that D5 retires in this same pass

D5 `:1187-1194`, new in this pass:

> **The "pure guards and deterministic fixture hooks may form the initial profile" formulation of
> earlier revisions names two classes with no available member today** … it should be described that
> way rather than by naming candidate extensions it cannot cover.

D1 `:447-449`, untouched:

> …which is what D5 already contemplates in "pure guards and deterministic fixture hooks may form the
> initial profile."

`:1168-1170` carries a third, partial version ("The 'pure guards may form the initial profile' line
must be read that narrowly"), which now describes a line D5 retires twenty lines later.

**Action:** rewrite `:447-449` to point at D5's retirement and state the first interim profile as the
real driver plus the main-loop cursor; reconcile or drop `:1168-1170`.

---

### R7. Two statements that a fully-excluded profile is "conformant and inert" are no longer unconditional

`:1096-1097` — "**a profile installing an extension whose hooks are all excluded is conformant and
inert rather than invalid**" — and `:445-446` — "so the profile is conformant and inert on the
compaction path". Under `:1124-1128` both are true only when the profile records the classifier-2
carve-out; without it the profile is rejected. Both predate the floor's restoration and neither was
updated.

**Action:** add the carve-out condition to both.

---

### R8. `ailang iface` is the right choice but is not gate infrastructure, and the ADR's endorsement omits three things an implementer needs

The pass makes a parsed interface "**the normative scanner**" (`:1305-1310`). The two hard cases it is
credited with are real — I re-derived both rather than inheriting them:

```text
$ ailang iface ~/.local/share/ailang/std/ai.ail | jq '.funcs[]|select(.name=="stepWithStream")'
{ "name": "stepWithStream",
  "type": "(string,list[Message],list[ToolSchema],list[CacheBreakpoint],(StreamChunk)->()!{IO})
           ->Result[...]!{AI}",
  "effects": ["AI"], "pure": true }

$ ailang iface ~/.local/share/ailang/std/list.ail | jq '[.funcs[]|select(.effects|length>0)]|length'
0        # the five ! {e} exports at std/list.ail:193,204,215,226,237 report no concrete effects
```

The result row is correctly isolated from the parameter row, and effect variables correctly yield
nothing. A walk of all 44 files succeeds (`ok=44 fail=0`). Three gaps:

1. **It is in no gate.** `grep -rn "ailang iface" .github/workflows/ Makefile scripts/` returns
   nothing. Neither classifier, nor the attribution table, is wired in either — already known — but
   the ADR now calls this one *normative*, which is a stronger claim than "available".
2. **The documented invocation form does not work.** `ailang --help` says `iface <module>`, yet on the
   pin only an absolute file path succeeds: `ailang iface std/list` fails from a scratch directory
   (`cannot read file 'std/list.ail'`) and fails from inside the scan root with a different error
   (`module name contains invalid characters … : list.ail`). All 44 succeed only via absolute paths.
3. **The emitted module identity is a mangled path.** The `std/list` walk reports
   `"module": "home/motoko/.local/share/ailang/std/list"`. A derivation that records module names —
   which is what obligation 1 produces — cannot use that field as-is, and it varies with the scan
   root's location, which would break the recorded-set comparison the obligation exists for.

Also: `"pure": true` appears on **12** effect-bearing `std/ai` exports (`call`, `callImage`,
`callJson`, …). `effects` is the only trustworthy field; a scanner keying on `pure` inverts the
answer.

**Action:** state that `effects` is the sole membership input and `pure` must be ignored; specify
absolute-path invocation and derive the module id from the path relative to the scan root rather than
from the `module` field; and move "wire the parsed-interface scan into CI" into the implementation
plan as the step that makes "normative" true.

---

### R9. The content-hash reference defeats the rationale given for making it a reference

`:967-973` has a profile record "**a *reference* to it — table identity, source-revision binding, and
content hash — not a copy**", justified as: "a correction to one global table would then require a
version bump on every profile, which is the opposite of what source-global buys."

A recorded **content hash** has exactly that cost. Correcting one row changes the hash, so every
profile's recorded reference mismatches and every profile must be re-issued — the same churn the
copy was rejected for. The reference form is still preferable (size, single source of truth, no
divergent copies), but not for the stated reason, and the question the handoff asks — "is that a
primary key, or does it need a version?" — is not answered: identity is nowhere specified.

**Action:** either drop the hash in favour of identity + source-revision binding and accept that
content can change under a profile, or keep the hash and replace the rationale with the honest one
(single source of truth, no divergent copies), stating that table corrections re-issue profiles.
Specify what "table identity" is.

---

### R10. Five spliced edits were not reflowed, and the overlong lines mark the un-propagated sites

The body wraps at ~100 columns. After this pass:

```text
$ awk 'length>110 && $0 !~ /^\|/ {print NR": "length}' body8.md
422: 153      446: 122      1080: 124      1160: 112      1195: 148
```

Baseline had four. `:422` and `:1195` are new and are both mid-paragraph splices — `:1195` is where D5
retires the "pure guards" formulation (R6), `:446` is the D1 sentence that still cites it. Cosmetic in
itself, but it is a reliable marker for text appended without re-reading the paragraph, which is the
defect class in R2–R7.

**Action:** reflow the paragraphs containing `:422`, `:446` and `:1195` while fixing them.

---

## What is accurate

Re-run and confirmed at `39e9b8d`:

- **Every anchor introduced or changed in this pass, with no error** — a third consecutive clean pass.
  `context_mode.ail:80`, `omnigraph.ail:69` (both `export func on_tool_policy`);
  `microrag/register.ail:189` (`on_tool_policy: microrag_tool_policy`) resolving to a constant
  `NoOpinion` at `:153-155`; `compose.ail:838` → `:83`; `std/ai.ail:318-324` (callback `! {IO}`,
  result `! {AI}`); `install-prerequisites.sh:586` (`-X …/internal/version.Commit=`);
  `reject_fixtures.ail:90`; `compaction_ai.ail:106`; `motoko-ext-abi/types.ail:151-165`.
- **The dominance withdrawal is factually exact and the withdrawal was the right call (A4).**
  `emit_dummy_hook` is `:187-195` with no guard; the attributed site `:190` is
  `kv("ts", jnum(intToFloat(now())))`; guards are at `:206, 222, 239, 280, 368`; calls at
  `:206, 222, 245, 287, 374`; the literal `"test_dummy"` is inside `is_test_dummy` at `:197-199`.
  Every number checks. Withdrawing rather than repairing is correct: the interprocedural version both
  seventh-pass reviews sketched is a successor-detector obligation, and specifying an unimplementable
  check in an ADR that already has one manual-inspection escape hatch would add a second.
- **The ABI enumeration and the eight-slot validation set (A2).** `ExtensionHooks` has ten fields, of
  which `id` and `provided_tools` are not hooks; the eight hooks are three rowless, `on_budget_plan` at
  `! {Env, FS}`, and four at the nine-effect row. "Disjoint and exhaust all eight ABI slots" is stated
  over the right set. `compaction_ai` registers all eight (`register.ail:100-109`), seven of them
  constant-returning lambdas, so the `compaction_ai`/`compose` comparison at `:1128-1133` is correct.
- **The empty-intersection rule no longer contradicts the mechanical rule (A3).** Codex R2's finding
  is answered: `:953-960` states one rule covering both cases, and it is consistent with the
  source-global bullet at `:983-991`.
- **The concentrated wrong-positive risk is disclosed plainly (A3).** With dominance gone, `:997-1000`
  keeps the worked false attribution (`src/core/rpc.ail:200` attributed to `test_dummy`), and
  `:1162-1164` says necessity "rests on the recorded named reviewer alone … rather than implying
  mechanical support it does not have". This is honest. It is nonetheless the largest residual risk in
  the ADR, and it grew in this pass: the empty-intersection correction converts that case from
  over-counting into removal from the reachable set, so a valid-but-false row now silently shrinks
  coverage where it previously did not. Necessary, but the ADR frames it only as a correctness fix.
- **Classifier 1's four scan repairs.** `std/ai/streaming.ail` has six effectful exports — three
  `['AI','Net','Stream']` and three `['Stream']` — so "rows *containing* `Stream`, not six literal
  `! {Stream}`" is the right correction (the source has only three literal `! {Stream}`). The
  recursive-walk note is exactly right: `shopt globstar` is `off` by default and `echo std/**/*.ail`
  from the scan root returns only `std/ai/streaming.ail`, dropping all 43 top-level files. The
  result-row rule is correct and `stepWithStream` is the right worked example.
- **The scan-root/compiler comparand.** `ailang --version` reports
  `Full: 3b52a24d24431c372ed5605289ef039592209514`, equal to `git -C ~/.local/share/ailang rev-parse
  HEAD`, and the tag is `v0.26.0` — the pin. Naming `Full:` as the comparand is a real repair.
- **Status block arithmetic (A8).** Seventeen sections − five = twelve; "twelve independent delta
  reviews (two each of the second through seventh correction passes)" is 6 × 2 = 12. Consistent. The
  count is not stale. The *content* staleness the handoff warned about is real but landed in the body
  (R5's `:50` is inside the Status block).
- **The D1 headline is repaired.** `:366-368` is grammatical with balanced bold markers.
- **No retired phrasing survives outside its retraction.** "textual reference" appears only at `:394`
  and `:435-436`, both retractions; "field-reference sites" and "`ai_step`-referencing" are gone.
- **Settled leads re-derived:** `.ai_step(` has exactly two call sites
  (`compaction_ai.ail:106`, `reject_fixtures.ail:90`); `std` has 44 `.ail` files, 43 top-level.

**The three explicit rulings requested:**

1. **Should the extension-granularity rule be narrowed to non-rowless hooks, and what happens to the
   carve-out? — No, reject the narrowing; the carve-out stands with one member.** The narrowing's
   premise fails on the pin: a rowless function calling an effectful function-valued record field
   type-checks and performs the effect (R1). `ExtPorts` is exactly such a record, so an empty ABI row
   is no barrier to reaching `ai_step`. `compaction_ai` therefore covers zero hooks, the classifier-2
   carve-out has a member, and the floor-plus-carve-out machinery is live. The disposition is right;
   the *justification* in the ADR is not, and must be repaired or this will move a fourth time.
2. **Is the floor-plus-disclosure pair coherent and decidable? — Coherent in design, decidable as
   stated, but not yet coherent as written.** The division of labour is right and the seventh pass's
   "disclosure achieves what the floor was for" claim is genuinely gone rather than reworded (it
   survives only at `:1120` as the thing being rejected). "Not every hook of an installed extension
   may be excluded", plus a recorded carve-out, is decidable from the profile definition alone: it
   reads the covered/excluded id sets and the carve-out list, all of which the profile records. But
   four passages still state the pre-restoration position (R2, R3, R4, R7), two of them inside the
   restoring passage. Per R1 the carve-out is reachable, so no path to zero coverage is closed off.
3. **Is `ailang iface` usable as normative gate infrastructure? — Usable, not yet infrastructure.**
   It resolves both hard cases correctly and succeeds on all 44 files, so the choice is sound. It is
   in no CI job, Makefile target or script; its documented `<module>` invocation does not work; its
   `module` field is a path-derived string; and its `pure` field contradicts its own `effects` field
   on 12 `std/ai` exports (R8). "Normative" is a commitment the repo has not yet made.

## Recommended pre-acceptance actions

**This ADR must fix, in order:**

1. **R1** — repair the extension-granularity justification and state the rowless-row limitation. It is
   the only finding that changes what the ADR asserts about the type system, and R2/R3/R7's wording
   depends on the carve-out surviving, which R1 settles.
2. **R2, R3, R4, R7** — the four passages contradicting the restored floor and the retracted
   satisfiability claim. Mechanical, and they are the same edit.
3. **R6** — reconcile D1 `:447-449` and `:1168-1170` with D5's retirement of the "pure guards"
   formulation.
4. **R5** — delete the two surviving "same words" clauses.
5. **R9** — specify "table identity" and fix the reference rationale.
6. **R8's first half** — state that `effects` is the sole input and `pure` must be ignored, and
   specify absolute-path invocation and scan-root-relative module ids.
7. **R10** — reflow while doing the above.

**Belongs to the implementation plan, not this ADR:**

- Wiring the parsed-interface scan, both classifiers, and the attribution table into CI — the step
  that makes "normative" true (R8).
- The documentation check that greps the canonical predicate phrasing and fails on drift. The ADR
  already assigns this to the plan at `:431-433`; after nine passes and three failed propagation
  claims, it should be sequenced early rather than listed.
- The interprocedural necessity check described at `:1160-1162`, as a successor-detector obligation.
- Upstream: `ailang iface`'s `pure` field disagreeing with its `effects` field, and `ailang check`
  not propagating effects through function-valued record-field calls (R1). The second is a soundness
  gap worth filing regardless of this ADR.

## Accept / revise recommendation

**Revise** — the rulings are right and the anchors are clean, but ten findings remain, one of which
(R1) invalidates a premise this pass newly made load-bearing and four of which (R2, R3, R4, R7) are
passages contradicting the pass's own central change; none require re-deriving the architecture, and
all are mechanical once R1 is settled. **The upstream API blocker is untouched by this review and
remains open on its own terms:** D1 still requires the recorded-stream API in an actual AILANG
release with this repository repinned and the positive integration probe passing;
`arniwesth/ailang`'s `stepWithStreamRecorded` on the `v0.31.0` tag remains a prototype and clears
none of those conditions. Clearing every finding above leaves that blocker in place.

## Review Comments

**Independent delta review of the eighth correction pass** — model `GPT-5 Codex`, 2026-08-02,
reviewed at `39e9b8d` against baseline `1cc1084`.

At the reviewed commit, `git show 39e9b8d:.../ADR-001-deterministic-test-world-architecture.md |
grep -c '^## Review Comments$'` returned **17**. Before this review began, the worktree already
contained an uncommitted eighteenth section by a different reviewer. It has not been deleted or
edited; this independently authored record is therefore the nineteenth section in the worktree while
remaining a review of the requested seventeenth-section target state. The committed ADR bytes are
identical at `39e9b8d` and worktree `HEAD` before those appended reviews (`sha256sum` for each
committed object: `f3a8950f3af3b076b6193c817e668db561af7cb1f4d7bec1339ccf8c5db1f0c9`).

**Verdict: Revise.** The pass fixes most of the nineteen triggering findings and carries no anchor
error, but it does not clear verification. Two executed probes overturn load-bearing premises: the
pinned effect checker accepts an effectful `ExtPorts`-shaped field call from a rowless function, and
`ailang iface` fails on one of the 44 stdlib files. The restored floor also remains bypassable by an
unvalidated carve-out and is contradicted by several unpropagated passages.

### R1. A rowless ABI declaration does not prove that a hook cannot call `ai_step`

**Defect:** The proposed narrowing to the five non-rowless hooks must be rejected, because pinned
AILANG fails to propagate effects through function-valued record-field calls and therefore permits a
rowless hook to call an `ExtPorts.ai_step`-shaped field.

**Grounding:** I built three scratch modules outside the repository. Direct `println` and a call to a
named `! {IO}` helper both fail as expected:

```text
$ ailang check mod/direct.ail
Missing effects: IO
Current signature: func rowless(...) -> T

$ ailang check mod/helper.ail
Missing effects: IO
Current signature: func rowless_hook(...) -> T
```

The same rowless hook calling a field with the exact nine-effect `ExtPorts.ai_step` row passes and
executes the effect:

```text
$ ailang check mod/field_full.ail
→ Effect checking...
✓ No errors found!

$ ailang run --entry main --caps IO mod/field_full.ail
EFFECT PERFORMED: called through the ExtPorts-shaped row
hook returned: ok
```

The relevant probe declarations were:

```ailang
type Ports = {
  ai_step: (string) -> string ! {AI, IO, Process, FS, Env, Net, SharedMem, Clock, Stream}
}
func rowless_hook(ports: Ports) -> string {
  ports.ai_step("called through the ExtPorts-shaped row")
}
```

That is the actual ABI shape at `packages/motoko-ext-abi/types.ail:62-67`; the rowless slots are at
`:154-155,158`. The ADR already records another accepted under-declaration at `ADR:1441-1445`, yet
`ADR:1140-1155` treats an empty declared row as proof of performed effect-freedom.

**Action:** retain the coarse every-hook classifier-2 rejection rule, retain the carve-out, and state
the actual reason: on the pin, an empty declared row does not bound effects reached through a
function-valued record field. Do not classify a rowless hook as effect-free from the ABI row alone;
require the source/typed-call inventory plus routing/hermeticity evidence, or fail it closed until the
declared-versus-performed checker is sound. File the record-field propagation defect upstream.

### R2. The disclosure example reports the coverage outcome of the rejected narrowing

**Defect:** `compaction_ai` cannot report three covered and five excluded hooks under the retained
extension-granularity rule; it reports zero covered and eight excluded with a classifier-2 carve-out.

**Grounding:** `ADR:1130-1135` says `compaction_ai` and `compose` “both report three covered and five
excluded,” while `ADR:1147-1148` says the extension-granularity rule “forces all eight to be
excluded.” The source grounds the latter: `compaction_ai.ail:106` calls `ctx.ports.ai_step`, and
`register.ail:100-109` registers all eight hooks. R1 rejects the only proposed reason to leave the
three rowless hooks covered.

**Action:** change the `compaction_ai` disclosure to zero covered/eight excluded plus the named
`ai_step` carve-out, and replace the equal-count comparison with a valid example or simply state that
hook ids reveal which slots—not merely how many—are covered.

### R3. A recorded carve-out is accepted without proving that classifier 2 forced it

**Defect:** The new floor is trivially bypassable because validation checks only that a zero-coverage
extension records some classifier-2 carve-out, not that the recorded extension/field pair occurs in
the source-bound classifier-2 call inventory.

**Grounding:** The complete body search is:

```text
$ git show 39e9b8d:.../ADR-001-...md | sed -n '1,2037p' |
    rg -n 'carve-out|zero-coverage|zero covered'
1074:- **coverage-floor carve-outs**: every installed extension with zero covered hooks ...
1075:  with the classifier-2 field that forced full exclusion. An extension with zero covered hooks and no
1076:  recorded carve-out is a profile-definition rejection (D5).
1137:The two are validated together at profile load ...
1138:ABI slots, and a zero-coverage extension must carry a recorded classifier-2 carve-out.
1734:... every installed extension covers at least one hook or carries a recorded classifier-2 carve-out ...
```

No reverse check appears. The classifier-derived sets may be recorded with the profile **or the
manifest** (`ADR:1402-1404`), so the claim at `ADR:1128-1129` that the legitimate carve-out is
decidable “from the profile definition alone” is also too strong. As written, a fully excluded
non-classifier-2 extension can name `ai_step` and pass the only stated floor check.

**Action:** require every carve-out `(extension id, classifier-2 field)` to match a row in the typed
call inventory bound to the same source/toolchain as the profile, reject false/unknown/stale pairs,
and require that inventory or its content-addressed reference in the profile rather than optionally
only in the per-run manifest.

### R4. `ailang iface` does not complete the recursive source scan and is not gate infrastructure

**Defect:** `ailang iface` is a useful parser output but cannot be the normative source-half gate as
stated because it fails on the pinned stdlib and is absent from every repository gate.

**Grounding:** A real recursive walk of the pinned clone produced:

```text
$ while IFS= read -r f; do
    if ailang iface "$f" >/dev/null 2>&1; then ok=$((ok+1));
    else printf 'FAIL %s\n' "$f"; fail=$((fail+1)); fi;
  done < <(find ~/.local/share/ailang/std -type f -name '*.ail' -print | sort)

The suggested relaxation is not accepted by this command (`ailang iface --relax-modules ...` returns
`flag provided but not defined`), and `AILANG_RELAX_MODULES=1` does not change the failure. Absolute
paths also produce location-dependent module ids (`"module":
"home/motoko/.local/share/ailang/std/list"`). The output is schema-tagged
`"ailang.iface/v1"`, but there is no checked scanner around it.

**Action:** describe `ailang iface` as the preferred parsed input, not established normative gate
infrastructure; specify path-relative module-id derivation, use only each function's `effects` field,
and require a tested textual fallback or fail-closed handling for every interface failure, including
`std/secret`. The implementation plan must wire the complete 44-file walk and reconciliation into CI
before the routing audit is citable.

### R5. Withdrawing local syntactic dominance is correct, but withdrawing all mechanical necessity evidence is not

**Defect:** A valid-but-false attribution can still silently remove a live core site while the ADR
promises an automated name-adoption gate, and the proposed interprocedural replacement is assigned to
an unrelated detector.

**Grounding:** `ADR:999-1001` states plainly that attributing `src/core/rpc.ail:200` to `test_dummy`
would drop a live `SharedMem` read and pass every mechanical check. `ADR:1016-1020` sketches the sound
interprocedural condition but says it “belongs to the successor detector”; `ADR:1441-1445` defines
that detector as **declared-versus-performed effect-row reconciliation**, which neither resolves
positive hook-id predicates nor proves dominance of all call sites. Meanwhile `ADR:1727-1728` says
all acceptance answers are supported by an automated gate.

The withdrawal’s factual premises are correct. At `src/core/ext/runtime.ail:187-195`, site `:190` is
inside unguarded `emit_dummy_hook`; `"test_dummy"` is in `is_test_dummy` at `:197-199`; guards are at
`:206,222,239,280,368`; and calls are at `:206,222,245,287,374`. The old local textual test did fail
its own example. That does not make a named reviewer an automated check.

**Action:** keep the local dominance rule withdrawn, but specify a distinct fail-closed attribution-
necessity validator: resolve the predicate to a positive equality against the attributed hook id,
prove every call to the containing helper is dominated by it, reject negation, and treat an
unprovable row as invalid/unconditional core. Alternatively, explicitly make manual review an
exception to the “automated gate” promise; the interprocedural version is the safer pre-acceptance
choice.

### R6. The restored floor is contradicted by four live pre-restoration statements

**Defect:** The body simultaneously restores a floor plus classifier-2 carve-out and continues to say
that disclosure—not a floor—is the anti-laundering mechanism and that full exclusion is
unconditionally conformant.

**Grounding:** The contradictions are local and direct:

- `ADR:1096-1097`: every fully excluded installed extension “is conformant and inert rather than
  invalid,” omitting the required carve-out.
- `ADR:1099`: “The anti-laundering mechanism is disclosure, not a structural floor.”
- `ADR:1100-1101`: the floor is “simultaneously vacuous and unsatisfiable,” while `ADR:1113` says
  “The floor was therefore satisfiable.”
- `ADR:1897-1900`: the `compaction_ai` case is recorded by disclosure “rather than a floor exempting
  it,” though this is the carve-out’s current member.

The live replacement is `ADR:1118-1138`: one mechanism rejects and one informs.

**Action:** make `ADR:1096-1097` conditional on a validated classifier-2 carve-out, replace the
`ADR:1099` topic sentence with the two-mechanism conclusion, remove “and unsatisfiable” at
`ADR:1100-1101`, and make Implementation Handoff item 2 name the carve-out rather than deny it.

### R7. Predicate canonicalisation still asserts “same words” where the words and site count differ

**Defect:** The pass removed “in the same words” from two headings but left two live assertions of it,
while the named normative sites use different formulations and additional normative statements sit
outside the claimed six.

**Grounding:** The body grep returns:

```text
$ git show 39e9b8d:.../ADR-001-...md | sed -n '1,2037p' | rg -n 'same words'
50:... six sites, same words ...
429:... the seventh asserted "six sites, same words" and was stale at three ...
439:... the claim here is checkable — six sites, same words ...
```

Line 429 is historical retraction; lines 50 and 439 are live claims. The Status wording at
`:42-45`, D1 at `:366-368,381-387,437-440`, D5 at `:1172-1179,1222-1224`, the acceptance row at
`:1734`, Consequences at `:1848-1850`, and the handoff at `:1897-1899` are substantively aligned on
today’s sole field but are neither six textual statements nor “the same words.” The future
documentation check at `:431-433` has no exact phrase/count to enforce.

**Action:** delete the two live “same words” claims and define the documentation check in terms of an
exact canonical predicate plus explicit normative anchors, or propagate one exact sentence and make
the claimed count match what the check actually scans.

### R8. D1 still cites the “pure guards” profile after D5 retires it

**Defect:** The pass retracts “pure guards and deterministic fixture hooks may form the initial
profile” in D5 but continues to rely on that formulation in D1.

**Grounding:** `ADR:447-449` says the first narrow profile is “what D5 already contemplates” in that
exact formulation; `ADR:1164-1170` says the pure-guards line must be read narrowly; and
`ADR:1187-1195` says the formulation has no available member and the initial profile should instead
be described as the real driver plus the main-loop cursor.

**Action:** replace the D1 citation with D5’s actual current conclusion—the real driver plus the
main-loop cursor—and remove or reconcile the earlier “read narrowly” paragraph.

### R9. The content-hash reference preserves the profile-version churn its rationale claims to remove

**Defect:** Changing a source-global attribution table still forces every referring profile to change
because its content hash is a semantic profile field, so the stated reason for replacing a copy with
a reference is false and “table identity” remains unresolved.

**Grounding:** `ADR:971-975` says a profile records table identity, source revision and content hash
to avoid a version bump on every profile after a global correction; `ADR:1068-1070` repeats that
tuple; and `ADR:1078` says changing any of those semantic scope fields requires a profile-version
change. A corrected table necessarily changes its hash.

**Action:** keep the content-addressed reference if immutability and reproducibility are intended, but
replace the churn rationale with the real benefits (one source of truth and no divergent embedded
copies), say that corrections reissue profile references/versions, and define the resolvable table
identity or state that `(source revision, content hash)` is the versioned identity.

### R10. Three new splice lines violate the body’s wrapping convention

**Defect:** Three lines introduced or rewritten by this pass remain unwrapped, including two sites
whose surrounding conclusions were not propagated.

**Grounding:** Excluding Markdown tables:

```text
$ git show 39e9b8d:.../ADR-001-...md | sed -n '1,2037p' |
    awk 'length($0)>110 && $0 !~ /^\|/ {print NR ":" length($0)}'
422:153
446:122
1080:124
1160:112
1195:148

$ # same command at 1cc1084
baseline_overlong=2
target_overlong=5
```

The three additions are `:422`, `:1160`, and `:1195`; `:1195` is the D5 retirement that R8 shows was
not propagated back into D1.

**Action:** reflow those three changed lines while applying the substantive corrections above.

## What is accurate

Re-run and confirmed at `39e9b8d`:

- **A1 ruling — do not narrow; the carve-out remains live.** The rowless-field probe in R1 defeats
  the narrowing’s type-system premise. The every-hook rule therefore remains the decidable safe
  approximation, `compaction_ai` covers zero hooks, and its classifier-2 carve-out remains necessary.
  The ADR must replace its decidability-only justification and its rowless-effect-freedom claim, not
  remove the carve-out.
- **A2 ruling — floor plus disclosure is coherent in design but not decidable/sound exactly as
  written.** Eight is the correct hook count: `ExtensionHooks` has ten fields at
  `packages/motoko-ext-abi/types.ail:151-165`, and `id` plus `provided_tools` are not hooks. The
  covered/excluded id sets can be checked from the profile. A carve-out’s *legitimacy* cannot; R3
  requires the source-bound classifier-2 inventory. The old “disclosure achieves what the floor was
  for” claim survives only as the rejected reasoning at `ADR:1118-1122`, but R6 leaves other
  pre-restoration claims live.
- **A3’s empty-intersection repair is internally consistent.** `ADR:953-963` now says a valid row
  whose hook set has empty intersection is unreachable, and only missing/invalid rows fall back to
  unconditional core; `ADR:983-990` says the same thing. The valid-but-false-row risk is also stated
  plainly at `ADR:991-1001`. R5 rules that disclosure alone does not satisfy the ADR’s automated-gate
  promise.
- **A4’s anchor diagnosis is exact.** `runtime.ail:187-195,197-199` and the five guard/call line sets
  all match. Withdrawing the broken *local* check was right; specifying the sketched interprocedural
  replacement as a separate fail-closed obligation is still required.
- **A5’s two hard cases are parsed correctly even though the all-file gate fails.** `ailang iface
  std/ai.ail | jq ...` reports `stepWithStream.effects == ["AI"]`, not callback `IO`; the five
  `std/list` effect-polymorphic exports report `effects: []`. The result-row rule is right.
  `std/ai/streaming.ail` reports six effectful exports (three `AI,Net,Stream`, three `Stream`), and the
  source contains only three literal `! {Stream}` rows. With default Bash `globstar` off, literal
  `std/**/*.ail` expands only to `std/ai/streaming.ail`; `find` reports 43 top-level files and 44
  recursively. The corrected “rows containing `Stream`” and recursive-walk wording are accurate.
- **The pin binding is correct.** `ailang --version` reports
  `Full: 3b52a24d24431c372ed5605289ef039592209514`, equal to `git -C
  ~/.local/share/ailang rev-parse HEAD`; the clone is tagged `v0.26.0`, and
  `scripts/install-prerequisites.sh:586` stamps that commit.
- **A6’s D1 headline is grammatical and its bold delimiters balance.** No live body text says
  “field-reference sites” or “`ai_step`-referencing”; “textual reference” occurs only in the
  retractions at `ADR:394,435-436`. R7 is about the surviving propagation/count claim, not a return
  of those retired predicates.
- **All A7 anchors are correct, for a third consecutive clean anchor pass.** Confirmed
  `context_mode.ail:80`; `omnigraph.ail:69`; `microrag/register.ail:189` resolving to constant
  `NoOpinion` at `:153-155`; `compose.ail:838` resolving to `:83`; stdlib `ai.ail:318-324`;
  `install-prerequisites.sh:586`; `reject_fixtures.ail:90`; and
  `runtime.ail:187-195,197-199,206,222,239,245,280,287,368,374`.
- **A8’s arithmetic is right.** The reviewed commit has seventeen `## Review Comments` sections;
  seventeen minus the two full reviews and three F1-F6 verifications is twelve delta reviews, exactly
  two for each of correction passes two through seven. The count is not stale; the content is (R6
  and R7).

Residual risk after the corrections remains concentrated in the manually asserted attribution
necessity and the not-yet-built typed call/interface scanners. The architecture’s source-global
empty-intersection semantics make a wrong positive especially consequential: it removes a site from
the reachable set rather than merely over-counting it.

## Recommended pre-acceptance actions

**This ADR must fix, in dependency order:**

1. **R1 and R2:** record the pinned record-field effect-checker limitation, retain the coarse
   extension rule/carve-out, and correct `compaction_ai` to zero/eight.
2. **R3, then R6:** bind each carve-out to a valid classifier-2 inventory row, then propagate the
   restored floor and validated carve-out through every live passage.
3. **R5:** give attribution necessity its own conservative interprocedural validation obligation (or
   explicitly weaken the automated-gate promise).
4. **R4:** demote `ailang iface` from established normative infrastructure to the preferred parsed
   input, specify the `std/secret` failure path/fallback and module-id derivation, and keep the routing
   audit non-citable until the complete scanner passes.
5. **R7 and R8:** make the predicate check mechanically defined and propagate the retired initial-
   profile formulation.
6. **R9:** define the attribution-table reference and correct its versioning rationale.
7. **R10:** reflow the changed prose with the substantive edits.

**Belongs to the implementation plan rather than this ADR’s body:**

- Build and wire classifier 1’s 44-file parsed/text fallback, classifier 2’s typed field-call
  inventory, carve-out validation, and the source-global attribution producer/validator into CI.
- Implement the separate interprocedural necessity proof described in R5; do not assign it to the
  declared-versus-performed effect-row reconciler.
- Add the exact predicate-drift documentation check after R7 defines its anchors and canonical text.
- File upstream issues for effect propagation through function-valued record fields and for `ailang
  iface` failing `std/secret` while offering an unsupported `--relax-modules` remedy.

## Accept / revise recommendation

**Revise.** The eighth pass is directionally correct and most factual repairs hold, but R1-R5 affect
the soundness or buildability of gates and R6-R9 leave the new conclusions internally inconsistent;
none requires reopening the settled architecture. **The upstream API blocker is unchanged and stays
open:** D1 still requires the recorded-stream API in an actual AILANG release, this repository
repinned to that release, and the positive integration probe passing. The
`arniwesth/ailang` `stepWithStreamRecorded` prototype on tag `v0.31.0` clears none of those conditions.

## Review Comments

_Reviewer: Claude Code (model: `claude-opus-5`), 2026-08-02. **Scoped architecture-acceptance
review** — not a delta review. Commit `a0d4edbc74c1e2632b413d3f2a6f88421e8f7a2a`. This is the
twentieth `## Review Comments` section; there were nineteen at the reviewed commit._

_Scope per `HANDOFF-review-adr-001-architecture-acceptance.md`: whether D1–D11 cohere and whether the
ADR is acceptable as a decision. The three deferred mechanisms' internal specifications, classifier
1's implementation, wording propagation, anchors, and the upstream blocker are out of scope and were
not reviewed as such._

### Recommendation

**Accept with conditions.** The architecture is sound. D1–D11 hold as a decision, the deferral of the
three gate mechanisms is legitimate rather than goalpost-moving (argued below), and no decision in
D1–D11 is unimplementable on the pinned substrate. Four changes are required first, all bounded and
none reopening a decision:

1. Reconcile D5's fail-closed-on-dispatch rule with the "conformant and inert" reading of a
   fully-excluded installed extension (R1). This is a real architectural incoherence and it
   invalidates a claim the ADR makes at four sites.
2. Name an in-profile first time-bearing seam (R2). The one D4 recommends does not exist inside any
   profile this ADR permits.
3. Complete the deferred-mechanism list, or narrow its claim (R3).
4. Delete the retired internal blocker where it still stands normatively (R4).

R1 and R2 are the ones that matter; R3 and R4 are single-paragraph repairs to the acceptance
boundary itself.

### On A1: the deferral is legitimate, and the test the handoff proposes passes

Applying the handoff's own test — *if all three deferred mechanisms turned out to be unbuildable,
would D1–D11 still be the right architecture?* — the answer is yes for all three, because each one's
absence degrades **conservatively**:

- **Classifier 2 unbuildable** → the extension-granularity rejection rule degrades to a manual
  determination over `grep -rn '\.ai_step('` plus triage, which the ADR already names as its
  conservative approximation (`:422-434`). Over-selection costs coverage; it does not admit an
  unsound profile.
- **The attribution table unbuildable** → D4 clause 3 vanishes and every core effect site is
  unconditional core. The ADR already states that fallback and its arithmetic (`5 / 13 / 13`
  pre-table versus `4 / 12 / 13` post-table, `:889-892`, `:1054-1058`). More routing work, no weaker
  claim.
- **Coverage-floor validation unbuildable** → the floor degrades to disclosure. This is the one case
  whose failure direction is fail-**open**, and the ADR says so in as many words (`:1161-1167`:
  without the reverse check "the floor is bypassable by assertion"). R1's fix removes that exposure
  by removing the configuration the carve-out exists to bless.

So the line is drawn in the right place: the architecture stands independently of the machinery, and
what the machinery buys is coverage and honesty, not soundness. The distinction the Status block
draws between a finite external list and a self-regenerating internal one is correct in kind. I do
not have a finding against the narrowing.

The acceptance criteria in *Gate mechanisms: built, and deferred* are sufficient to discharge each
mechanism **as stated**, with one caveat carried in R3: the list of mechanisms is not the list of
deferred gate-read artifacts.

---

### R1. A fully-excluded installed extension cannot complete a run, so "conformant and inert" is unreachable — and it is the case one deferred mechanism exists to permit

**Defect.** D5 requires that dispatch reaching an excluded hook produce a fail-closed
`HarnessFailure` (`:382`, `:1124`, `:1254`), but six of the eight ABI hook slots are folded
unconditionally over *every* installed extension on the ordinary execution path — so a profile that
installs an extension and excludes all eight of its hooks fails closed on its first step, in every
run. The ADR asserts the opposite at four sites.

**Grounding.** Hook dispatch is an unconditional fold over `rt.registry.hooks`, with no per-extension
gate:

```
$ grep -n "(h\.on_" src/core/ext/runtime.ail
205:      let patch = (h.on_build_system_prompt)(ctx);     -- fold_prompt_hooks
220:      let patch = (h.on_budget_plan)(ctx, plan);        -- fold_budget_hooks
238:      let decision = (h.on_pre_step)(ctx, msgs);        -- fold_pre_step_chain_rec
279:  let decision = (h.on_tool_policy)(ctx, call);         -- decide_one_policy
338:        match (h.on_tool_handle)(ctx, call) {           -- first_handle (gated by contains_tool)
355:      match (h.on_response_intercept)(ctx, response_text) {
367:  let decision = (h.on_solver_candidate)(ctx, candidate);
```

Only `on_tool_handle` is conditional (`first_handle` tests `contains_tool(h.provided_tools, name)`,
`:337`). `dispatch_build_system_prompt`, `dispatch_budget_plan`, and `dispatch_pre_step_chain`
(`:212`, `:228`, `:274`) each pass `rt.registry.hooks` whole. And the extension the ADR uses as its
worked example supplies all of them:
`packages/motoko-ext-compaction-ai/register.ail:101-106` binds `on_build_system_prompt`,
`on_budget_plan`, `on_pre_step`, and `on_tool_policy`.

Therefore, for a profile installing `compaction_ai` with all eight hooks excluded, the first
system-prompt build reaches an excluded hook — before any provider call — and the run terminates as
`HarnessFailure`. The affected claims:

- `:384` — "excluding every hook it registers is conformant and honest";
- `:460` — "the profile is conformant and **inert on the compaction path**";
- `:1128` — "A profile installing an extension whose hooks are all excluded is conformant and inert
  rather than invalid";
- `:1790` — the acceptance row's carve-out clause, and `:1906-1909` in *Consequences*.

"Inert" means the run proceeds and the extension does nothing. What actually happens is that no run
completes. The practical claim built on it — "**all fourteen** checked-in configurations can be made
conformant by excluding `compaction_ai`'s hooks" (`:455-461`) — is vacuous: those profiles produce
zero `SystemRun`s, so they cannot satisfy D11's minimum-completed-count gate or any D7 invariant.

Note that the fourth correction pass's rejected conclusion ("not conformance-eligible") was closer to
right than the fifth pass's replacement, but for a reason neither pass considered: not the classifier
rule, the **dispatch shape**. Both passes reasoned about profile-definition validity without checking
whether such a profile can execute.

**Why this is architectural rather than editorial.** Exclusion is only a meaningful runtime
classification for hooks whose dispatch is *conditional*. For the six unconditionally-folded slots,
"excluded and installed" is not a weaker form of "installed" — it is equivalent to "un-runnable". The
coverage floor's single carve-out (`:1104-1106`, `:1157-1167`) and the fourth deferred mechanism
(`:1762`) exist precisely to bless the zero-covered installed extension, i.e. to permit a
configuration that cannot execute.

**Action.** State the rule the dispatch shape actually forces: *an extension with any
unconditionally-dispatched hook excluded may not be installed in a conformant profile.* Concretely —

- correct `:384`, `:460`, `:1128`, `:1906-1909` to say the fourteen configurations are made
  conformant by **removing** `compaction_ai` from the profile's install list, not by excluding its
  hooks (this also aligns them with `:1270`, which already says the first interim profile is "the
  real driver plus the main-loop cursor");
- either delete the coverage-floor carve-out and restore the floor unconditionally, or restrict the
  carve-out to extensions all of whose excluded hooks are conditionally dispatched (today: only
  `on_tool_handle`);
- update the acceptance row at `:1790` to match.

This *simplifies* the deferred set rather than growing it: with the carve-out gone, deferred
mechanism 4 collapses to "profile load rejects a zero-coverage installed extension", classifier 2 is
no longer in the floor's dependency chain, and the fail-open direction identified in A1 above
disappears. That the fix reduces machinery is the strongest evidence I found that D1–D11 are right.

### R2. D4's recommended first time-bearing seam does not exist inside any profile this ADR permits, so the pillar-5 acceptance row has no interim path

**Defect.** D4 tells the plan to make "a typed tool or delegated-process request whose **existing**
timeout becomes an explicit live/deterministic adapter contract" the first time-bearing seam
(`:934-938`). No module that can be inside a conformant interim profile enforces a time-based
deadline. Every existing timeout is either extension-resident and excluded, or enforced outside the
simulation boundary.

**Grounding.** The two adapters the ADR's own Context row cites as grounding for that seam (`:257`)
are `packages/motoko-ext-mcp/exec.ail:45-70` and
`packages/motoko-ext-context-mode/context_mode.ail:120-128` — both extension packages, both named at
`:217` and `:259` as bypassing `ExtCtx.ports`, and therefore both excluded by D5 (`:1263`) until
migrated. Even after migration they are reached through `on_tool_handle`/`on_pre_step`, which the ABI
pins at nine effects, so under D5's declared-row rule they stay excludable-only (`:1222-1227`).

Core has no time-based deadline:

```
$ grep -rn "timeout\|deadline" src/core/tool_runtime.ail src/core/tool_phase.ail
src/core/tool_phase.ail:88:  if default_allow then ApprovalAllowed else ApprovalDenied("timeout — no approval received")
src/core/tool_runtime.ail:824:  Timeout(ms) => "timeout after ${show(ms)}ms",
```

`tool_phase.ail:86-88` (`resolve_approval(raw, default_allow, eof)`) is EOF-driven, not clock-driven —
the word "timeout" is a label on the EOF branch. `tool_runtime.ail:824` is a display arm of an error
type; `grep -rn "Timeout(" src/core/*.ail` returns that consumer and no producer. The one core
deadline *value*, `delegated_timeout_ms`, is only forwarded into the child-process settings record
(`src/core/config.ail:346` → `src/core/rpc.ail:40,176`, no comparison anywhere in the AILANG tree),
so it is enforced in the TypeScript child — outside the simulation boundary (`:1281-1284`) and
outside classifier 1's stated soundness boundary (`:1372-1377`).

**Consequence.** The acceptance row "Does virtual time matter?" (`:1792`) requires two programs
differing only in latency to produce different completion-versus-timeout behaviour. On the reading
D4 recommends, satisfying it requires the extension-ABI major — which makes pillar-5 evidence
dependent on the same milestone as extension coverage, a sequencing fact the ADR does not state.

**Action.** Correct `:934-938` to name the seam D1 already mandates: the typed `ToolCallEnvelope`
with "timeout/deadline information" replacing the stringly `tool_exec` (`:591-593`). That seam is in
core, in-profile, and is a widening this ADR requires anyway — so pillar-5 evidence is reachable
without the ABI major. Drop or qualify "existing timeout", and state plainly that no in-profile
module observes time today. (This is not "inventing a new agent retry policy", which `:938` rightly
forbids; it is the deadline contract D1 specifies.)

### R3. The deferred-mechanism list is not the list of deferred gate-read artifacts, which under-states what the Status block calls a finite list

**Defect.** *Gate mechanisms: built, and deferred* claims "This ADR names four detection/validation
mechanisms" (`:1747`) and the Status block leans on that count — "What replaces it is a finite list:
the three deferred gate mechanisms" (`:27-30`). The ADR names at least two further unbuilt,
gate-read, fail-closed-validated artifacts of the same kind, and neither appears in the table.

**Grounding.**

- **D3's fault catalogue** (`:754-760`): "a versioned, machine-readable artifact that the gate reads —
  not prose in an implementation plan", carrying class ids, applicability conditions, delivery
  constructors, named recovery-branch ids, and logical transitions. D11's branch-reached counters
  read it (`:1712-1717`) and acceptance row 4 requires it (`:1791`). Nothing in the repo implements
  it.
- **D6's event vocabulary** (`:1564-1598`): explicitly "new construction", "validated at load and
  **fails closed** on an unclassified variant", and load-bearing enough that D6 forbids scheduling
  "any D7 parity invariant or acceptance row that depends on the logical/display-only classification
  before the artifact exists" (`:1586-1588`). That gates D7's parity invariant (`:1606`) and
  acceptance row 7 (`:1794`).

Both are the same *kind* of thing as the site-to-hook attribution table, which the section does list:
a constructed, versioned artifact with a fail-closed load validator and a manual correctness
condition. Excluding them is not a principled boundary, and it makes the finite list read as three
items when it is five.

**Action.** Add rows for D3's catalogue and D6's vocabulary with the acceptance criteria both
decisions already state, or narrow `:1747` to "four *hermeticity and coverage* detectors" and
cross-reference the other two deferred artifacts explicitly so the Status block's "finite list" is
complete.

**Related, smaller.** The acceptance table's preamble promises that "all answers below are supported
by an automated gate" (`:1783-1784`), while D4 records a stated exception to exactly that promise —
attribution necessity rests on a named human reviewer (`:1044-1050`), as does the gate table's row 3
(`:1761`). The exception is stated twice already; it is simply absent from the table that makes the
promise. One clause at `:1784` closes it.

### R4. The retired internal blocker still stands normatively in `Depends on`

**Defect.** The Status block's central reframing is that "the latest correction pass has not been
independently verified" was "a mistake of kind, not of fact" and is retired (`:18-30`). The
`Depends on` block still states the opposite as a live condition.

**Grounding.** `:126-127`: "This ADR's remaining acceptance blockers are its own: the upstream
recorded-stream API **and an independent review**." Also `:2093-2094` in the author self-review
record ("A fresh independent review must attack the revised decisions before this ADR becomes
Accepted") — that one is a dated 2026-07-24 record and defensible as history, but `:126-127` is not
dated or attributed and reads as current.

This is not a phrasing variant; it is a second, contradictory statement of what blocks acceptance, in
the block a reader consults to find out what blocks acceptance. Left in place it re-creates the
self-regenerating condition by citation.

**Action.** At `:126-127`, replace "and an independent review" with the current framing: the upstream
recorded-stream API is the sole external acceptance blocker; the three (or five, per R3) deferred
mechanisms block the name.

---

### What I re-ran and confirmed

- **Section count.** 19 `## Review Comments` sections at `a0d4edb`; this is the twentieth. Consistent
  with the Status block's derived count (`19 − 5 = 14` delta reviews).
- **The loop measurements in the Status block are exact.** Counting `^### R\d+\.` headings per
  section gives **154 findings** across 19 sections, and pairing the delta rounds gives
  `7+8=15, 6+6=12, 8+8=16, 8+8=16, 10+7=17, 10+9=19, 10+10=20` — precisely the
  15, 12, 16, 16, 17, 19, 20 quoted at `:22`. The divergence claim is verifiable and correct.
- **Classifier 1 runs and meets its stated acceptance criterion.** `make effect_inventory` exits 0
  with toolchain and scan-root commits matching (`3b52a24d`), reporting 21 builtin-projection modules,
  25 source-scan, 25 union, 21 imported, **13 effect-bearing, 8 proven effect-free, 0 unresolved**,
  with `std/secret`'s `MOD010` failure resolved by the textual fallback — exactly the numbers at
  `:1364-1382`. `make effect_inventory_selftest` reports `agree=43 disagree=0`, also as stated.
- **Hook dispatch is an unconditional fold** over `rt.registry.hooks` for six of eight slots (R1).
- **Two `.ai_step(` call sites** repo-wide (`compaction_ai.ail:106`,
  `reject_fixtures.ail:90`); **zero `ExtPorts.clock_now` call sites** — only declarations and
  constructions (`src/core/ports.ail:20`, `packages/motoko-ext-abi/types.ail:65`, and four `noop_`
  bindings). Both settled facts hold at this commit.
- **`src/core/ports.ail` already imports `StreamChunk`** (`:9`), so D1's emission-log widening is
  expressible in the module D1 names, with no new module-cycle exposure.
- **No time-based deadline anywhere in `src/core`** (R2).

### On A2–A5, where I found nothing

- **A2 (coherence).** Beyond R1, the seams the handoff flagged hold. D2's strict/regression modes and
  D8's reproduction artifact agree on the manifest (`:659`, `:1639`, `:1722-1727`). D6.4's stream
  exception and D7's parity invariant agree, given the vocabulary dependency D6 already states.
  D4's clock routing and D5's hermeticity gate agree, including the non-obvious case: classifier 2
  excludes `clock_now` precisely so that routing *into* it is not a rejection trigger (`:1398-1405`).
  D1's interim widening and D5's exclusion rule agree on the exclusion itself; what they disagree
  about is what an exclusion costs at run time, which is R1.
- **A3 (implementability).** I found no decision that assumes something the recorded substrate limits
  forbid. The interim widening's discard at `src/core/session.ail:662` is a known-broken call site
  managed by profile exclusion, and under R1's fix it becomes unreachable in any conformant profile
  rather than merely excluded — strictly better.
- **A4 (scope boundary).** Nothing in D1–D11 requires a durability or concurrency contract Motoko
  lacks. D3's "all-or-nothing logical update" is a property of the simulator's modeled state, not a
  claim about real atomicity, and D9's reopening triggers plus 007 D1.3's five verbatim triggers
  still cover the cases that would invalidate the exclusion.
- **A5 (Status honesty).** Accurate and verifiable on the numbers, with the single exception of R4.

### Residual risk

1. **R1's fix narrows the interim profile to "no extensions installed" for every checked-in
   configuration.** That is the honest position and the ADR half-states it already (`:1270`), but it
   means the interim milestone delivers no extension coverage at all, and the plan should be written
   knowing that rather than discovering it.
2. **Necessity remains manually reviewed**, and under the empty-intersection rule a wrong positive
   *shrinks* the reachable set silently. The ADR names this (`:1044-1050`); it stays the largest
   correctness hole in the deferred layer, and it is not closed by anything R1–R4 propose.
3. **The three rowless ABI slots are coverable only by assumption**, resting on the runtime
   hermeticity probe rather than the type system (`:1203-1206`). After R1's fix, every installed
   extension must cover at least one of exactly those three slots — so the floor's only satisfiable
   form depends entirely on that assumption. The ADR discloses it; it is worth the plan re-testing it
   against the record-field propagation gap before the first covering profile ships.
4. **I did not re-verify** the three deferred mechanisms' internal specifications, classifier 1's
   implementation beyond running it and its selftest, anchor precision, or the upstream blocker —
   all out of scope by the handoff.

### Accept / revise recommendation

**Accept with conditions**: R1, R2, R3, R4. None reopens a decision; R1 and R2 correct a claim and a
recommendation that do not survive contact with the source, and both fixes make the architecture
smaller. The external prerequisite is unchanged and tracked separately: the upstream recorded-stream
API must land in a released AILANG, the toolchain must be repinned, and D1's positive integration
probe must pass. The fork prototype does not satisfy it, and nothing in this review touches it.

### Independent Codex verification addendum

_Reviewer: OpenAI Codex (model: `GPT-5`), 2026-08-02. Commit
`a0d4edbc74c1e2632b413d3f2a6f88421e8f7a2a`. The twentieth review section above was already present
as uncommitted work when this verification began. It is preserved verbatim; this additive note records
an independent disposition without creating a false twenty-first `## Review Comments` section._

#### Recommendation

**Accept with conditions.** D1–D11 are a sound, implementable architecture, and the three detector
deferrals are legitimate rather than goalpost-moving. Three finite corrections are required before
the ADR moves to Accepted:

1. Correct the fully-excluded-extension semantics and interim-profile consequence (R1).
2. Reconcile the automated-gate promise with D4's expressly manual attribution exception (R2).
3. Remove the now-discharged independent-review blocker from the current dependency/status framing
   (R3).

None changes the selected architecture. The upstream recorded-stream release, repin, and positive
integration probe remain a separate external prerequisite; the fork prototype clears none of them.

#### R1. A fully excluded installed extension is fail-closed, not inert, so the stated interim profile cannot complete the name-adoption corpus

**Defect.** D1 and D5 call a fully excluded installed extension “conformant and inert”
(`:379-386`, `:455-461`, `:1123-1130`), but the same decisions require dispatch to any excluded hook
to return `HarnessFailure`; ordinary prompt, budget, and pre-step dispatch visits every installed
extension, so an installed `compaction_ai` with all eight hooks excluded cannot produce the completed
`SystemRun` corpus D11 requires.

**Grounding.** `src/core/ext/runtime.ail:201-229,234-275` folds build-prompt, budget, and pre-step
dispatch over `rt.registry.hooks` without an extension-level skip;
`packages/motoko-ext-compaction-ai/register.ail:97-109` registers all of those hooks; and
`src/core/session.ail:1696-1699` invokes pre-step dispatch on the model path. This directly conflicts
with the claimed inertness and with the checked-configuration consequence at `:455-461` and
`:1904-1909`.

**Action.** State that exclusion is fail-closed, not inert. A name-eligible interim profile must omit
an extension whose always-dispatched hooks are excluded (for the present case, remove
`compaction_ai` from the profile's installed-extension list), unless a real pre-dispatch omission
mechanism is first designed and implemented. Align D1, D5, the acceptance row, and Consequences; do
not delete the general exclusion mechanism, which remains useful for conditional paths and negative
conformance probes.

#### R2. The acceptance table promises complete automation while D4 and the gate table expressly permit manual attribution evidence

**Defect.** The acceptance preamble says every answer is supported by an automated gate
(`:1781-1784`), while D4 makes attribution necessity a named-reviewer exception (`:1044-1050`) and
the deferred-mechanism criterion repeats that exception (`:1761`).

**Grounding.** Those three clauses give mutually exclusive answers about whether a profile may cite a
manually accepted site-to-hook row before the interprocedural validator exists; this bears directly
on the clock-routing and hermeticity answers at `:1790-1792`.

**Action.** Either qualify the preamble with the already-declared manual exception, or require the
interprocedural validator before name adoption. The conservative no-table fallback—classifying every
such site as unconditional core—also remains valid and fully automated.

#### R3. The current dependency block retains the independent-review blocker that the Status block retires and this review discharges

**Defect.** The Status block says the only remaining acceptance blocker is external (`:11-30`), but
`Depends on` still lists “an independent review” as a current blocker (`:126-127`), and the D5
verification marker still describes the built replacement detector as unverified (`:1470-1475`).

**Grounding.** At the reviewed commit these are substantive blocker statements, not dated review
history. This scoped architecture review supplies the independent review, and execution of
`make effect_inventory` plus `make effect_inventory_selftest` met classifier 1's published criterion:
zero unresolved imported modules and `agree=43 disagree=0`.

**Action.** Remove the current independent-review blocker and retire or date the D5 marker. Keep the
three deferred mechanisms as name-adoption blockers and the released upstream API as the separate
external prerequisite.

#### Disposition of the two other conditions proposed above

- **The proposed D4 time-seam condition is not a finding.** D1 already requires typed native and
  delegated tool requests carrying deadline information (`:573-592`), and D4 explicitly places real
  shell/process timeout enforcement behind the live adapter while the deterministic adapter compares
  modeled completion time to that deadline (`:915-925`). `src/core/env_client.ail:14-15,31-36`
  demonstrates the existing production shape—a timeout-bearing request whose enforcement is outside
  the AILANG driver—and `src/core/tool_catalog.ail:53` exposes a core `timeout_secs` request field.
  Moving that fact into the D1 boundary is the implementation D4 calls for; its present location is
  not an absent or unimplementable seam.
- **The proposed expansion of the four-mechanism table is not a finding.** The table explicitly scopes
  itself to detection/validation mechanisms (`:1745-1757`), not every unbuilt architecture artifact.
  D3's fault catalogue and D6's event vocabulary are first-class architecture components with their
  own fail-closed acceptance contracts, not omitted classifiers. Treating them as two more rows would
  conflate implementation components with the detector layer the deferral section deliberately
  isolates.

#### What I re-ran and confirmed

- At commit `a0d4edb`, the ADR has 9,734 lines, exactly 19 `## Review Comments` sections, and 154
  `### Rn.` findings. The paired delta totals are `15, 12, 16, 16, 17, 19, 20`; the divergence claim
  is correct.
- `make effect_inventory` exited 0 with matching toolchain/scan-root commit `3b52a24d`, 25 modules in
  the union, 21 imported, 13 effect-bearing, 8 proven effect-free, and the sole interface failure
  (`std/secret`, `MOD010`) resolved by the textual fallback. `make effect_inventory_selftest` reported
  `agree=43 disagree=0`.
- `rg -n '\.ai_step\(' src packages -g '*.ail'` returned exactly the two settled call sites;
  `rg -n 'clock_now\(' src packages -g '*.ail'` returned only four `noop_clock_now` declarations and
  no `ExtPorts.clock_now` call.
- D2/D8 agree on exact-program replay plus the execution manifest; D4/D5 agree on a single explicit
  clock and fail-closed ambient-effect handling; D6/D7 agree on returned-trace authority and the
  explicit stream-parity exception. Beyond R1, the interim provider-state widening and extension
  exclusion rule cohere.
- No decision assumes physical durability or concurrent ledger mutation. D3's logical commit/no-commit
  state is simulator state, and D9 carries the accepted reopening triggers for concurrency.
- If any deferred mechanism proves unbuildable, D1–D11 remain the right architecture: classifier 2
  can conservatively force extension omission/full exclusion, the attribution table can fall back to
  unconditional-core classification, and an unavailable carve-out validator can reject all
  zero-coverage installed extensions. The stated acceptance criteria are sufficient to discharge the
  narrower mechanisms when built.

#### Residual risk

- The first honest interim name-eligible profile has no `compaction_ai` and may have no extension
  behavior at all; extension coverage waits on narrower ABI rows or the world-token ABI major.
- Until the attribution-necessity validator exists, a false manual attribution can silently shrink a
  profile's reachable set. The ADR discloses this; using the unconditional-core fallback avoids it at
  the cost of more routing work.
- Classifier 2, the attribution mechanism, and coverage-floor validation were assessed only at their
  acceptance boundaries, not internally specified or prototyped, per the review scope.
