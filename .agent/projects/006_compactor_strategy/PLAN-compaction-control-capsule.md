# PLAN: compaction control capsule

**Status**: Plan (not started). This is an extension-side refinement to the AI compactor summary
format. It is deliberately separate from `.agent/issues/silent-empty-stop-finalize.md`, which covers
what core should do after the model returns a premature `stop`.

**Source issue**: `../../issues/compaction-summary-loses-task-control-state.md`.

**Observed failure**: latest live run
`.motoko/logfile/session_2026-07-10T10-35-14-469Z.jsonl` ended cleanly at step 47 with
`finish_reason:"stop"` and "What would you like to work on?" after AI compaction summarized the
working window down to 12 messages. The model interpreted the compacted context as a fresh context
handoff, not a continuation of the original stress task.

---

## TL;DR

The previous compactor-strategy fix made compaction effective, but the live stress run exposed a
new upstream control-loss problem: the AI summary shrank the sent window correctly, then Qwen read
the `[CONTEXT SUMMARY]` as a fresh-session handoff and stopped at step 47. Do **not** solve this by
changing core stop/finalize behavior here; that is already tracked by
`.agent/issues/silent-empty-stop-finalize.md`.

Fix the AI compactor summary format so task-control state is deterministic, not summarizer-dependent:
wrap the AI prose in a runtime control capsule containing `ctx.task`, current step/model, "this is not
a fresh session", active continuation/stop obligations, and mirrored runtime-status facts when
available. Harden the summarizer prompt too, but treat it as quality improvement only; correctness
comes from the deterministic capsule. Verify with direct compactor tests and a DST where the
summarizer returns hostile prose such as "What would you like to work on?".

## Blast Radius

| File | Kind | Change |
|------|------|--------|
| `packages/motoko-ext-compaction-ai/compaction_ai.ail` | **extension** | Replace `summary_msg(summary)` with a context-aware control-capsule builder; thread `ctx` and optional status facts into the compacted summary message; harden `summarization_prompt`; add pure extraction helpers for latest `MotokoRuntimeStatus` facts; add unit tests. |
| `scripts/long_qwen_compaction_dst.ail` | test | Update the existing direct-compactor scenarios and add one hostile/weak summarizer scenario with a task containing explicit stop/status obligations; assert the compacted segment preserves the capsule and still passes `validate_compactor_output`. |
| `.agent/issues/compaction-summary-loses-task-control-state.md` | docs | Update status when implemented. |
| `ailang.lock` | metadata | Refresh only if package content hashes change during implementation. Do not churn it for plan-only edits. |

**Expected not to touch:**
- `src/core/step_machine.ail` and `src/core/session.ail` stop/finalize behavior. That belongs to
  `.agent/issues/silent-empty-stop-finalize.md`.
- `src/core/compaction.ail` calibration.
- structural compaction (`packages/motoko-ext-compaction-structural/**`).
- retained history persistence (`st.msgs` remains full/uncompacted).
- `packages/motoko-ext-abi/types.ail`; no ABI change is needed because `ExtCtx` already exposes the
  required state.

---

## 0. Scope

Fix the AI compactor so its inserted summary cannot erase or reframe the active control contract.

In scope:
- Add deterministic task-control text around the AI-produced summary.
- Tighten the summarizer prompt so it extracts control state too.
- Preserve/mirror recent runtime status fields when present.
- Add deterministic unit/DST coverage.

Out of scope:
- Core stop/finalize guard behavior (`silent-empty-stop-finalize.md` owns it).
- Persisting compaction into retained history.
- Context calibration.
- Retained-history bounding.
- Structural compaction strategy.

---

## 1. Grounding

Current implementation:
- `packages/motoko-ext-compaction-ai/compaction_ai.ail:53` `summarization_prompt(old_turns, recent_turns)`
  asks for a 2-3 sentence summary and generic "Current task state".
- `packages/motoko-ext-compaction-ai/compaction_ai.ail:170` `summary_msg(summary)` emits exactly one
  assistant message: `[CONTEXT SUMMARY] ${summary}`.
- `packages/motoko-ext-compaction-ai/compaction_ai.ail:219` `compact_with_ai(ctx, msgs, cfg)` has the
  `ExtCtx`, so it already has `ctx.task`, `ctx.step`, `ctx.model`, `ctx.context_limit`,
  `ctx.telemetry`, and `ctx.history_slice` available without ABI changes.
- `packages/motoko-ext-compaction-ai/compaction_ai.ail:224` halves `keep_recent` at high pressure
  (`pct >= 90`). In the live profile `keep_recent=10`, so only 5 recent messages are protected when
  compaction pressure is highest.
- `src/core/session.ail:1628-1632` confirms the pre-step hook output is sent for this step only;
  compaction remains ephemeral. The full retained history persists at `session.ail:1710`.

Latest log evidence:
- `.motoko/logfile/session_2026-07-10T10-35-14-469Z.jsonl:7324`: structural only applied
  `tier=tier1 keep_last=10`.
- `.motoko/logfile/session_2026-07-10T10-35-14-469Z.jsonl:7506-7873`: AI summarized 158-178 turns
  every step from 39 to 47.
- `.motoko/logfile/session_2026-07-10T10-35-14-469Z.jsonl:7875`: step 47 sent `msg_count:12`.
- `.motoko/logfile/session_2026-07-10T10-35-14-469Z.jsonl:8001`: model stopped with a "new context
  window" handoff question.

Interpretation: the compactor is now effective at shrinking, but the replacement message is too
semantically lossy for control state. The model receives "summary of prior context" without a
deterministic statement that the original task remains active.

---

## 2. Design

### 2.1 Add a deterministic control capsule

Replace `summary_msg(summary)` with a context-aware builder, e.g.
`summary_msg(ctx, summary, control)`, that emits a fixed-format assistant message:

```text
[RUNTIME COMPACTION SUMMARY]
This message was inserted by Motoko compaction. It is not a new user request, not a fresh session,
and not permission to stop. Continue the original task.

ORIGINAL TASK:
<ctx.task>

RUNTIME STATE:
- current_step_before_request: <ctx.step>
- model: <ctx.model>
- compaction: active; older turns were summarized for this request only

ACTIVE CONTROL OBLIGATIONS:
- Continue satisfying ORIGINAL TASK.
- Do not ask what to work on next unless ORIGINAL TASK is complete.
- Preserve explicit stop conditions from ORIGINAL TASK.
- If ORIGINAL TASK requires tool/status cadence, continue that cadence.

LATEST RUNTIME STATUS:
<optional extracted status facts, or "not observed in compacted segment">

AI SUMMARY OF OLDER CONTEXT:
<summary>
```

The capsule is deterministic. The summarizer can produce a bad or incomplete summary and the
important control facts still survive.

### 2.2 Extract control facts cheaply

Minimum viable implementation:
- Use `ctx.task` verbatim for `ORIGINAL TASK`.
- Use `ctx.step`, `ctx.model`, and `ctx.context_limit` for `RUNTIME STATE`.
- Include static obligations exactly as strings.
- Build the capsule at compaction time from `ctx` and the current `msgs`; cache only the AI prose
  summary. Do not cache the entire capsule under the old-turn digest, because step/status/task fields
  are request-local and would become stale if replayed from artifacts.

Optional but recommended in the same work:
- Detect the latest `MotokoRuntimeStatus` tool result in `msgs` before splitting. Prefer correlation
  over content guessing: find assistant tool calls whose `name == "MotokoRuntimeStatus"`, then find
  matching tool messages by `tool_call_id`. A content marker fallback
  (`"tool":"MotokoRuntimeStatus"`) is acceptable only for legacy/fixture messages.
- Parse only cheap JSON/string markers if full JSON parsing is awkward, and mirror:
  - `current_step`
  - `step_budget`
  - `finish_reason_so_far`
  - `stage_applied_total`
  - `compaction_ai_applied`
- If no status result exists, emit `LATEST RUNTIME STATUS: not observed in compacted segment`.
- If using a raw excerpt fallback, bound it tightly (for example 1-2 KB) and prefer whitelisted field
  lines over copying the full tool result; the capsule should not re-inflate the context it is trying
  to shrink.

Do not make this extraction a hard dependency on well-formed status JSON; malformed/missing status
must still produce the deterministic capsule.

### 2.3 Tighten the summarizer prompt

Change `summarization_prompt` to include explicit instructions:
- Extract original task objective when present.
- Extract unresolved stop conditions and progress gates.
- Extract status/progress facts.
- Extract next required action.
- Do not describe this as a new session, fresh context window, or handoff.
- Do not ask the user what to do next unless the old turns show the task is complete.

This is a quality improvement, not the correctness boundary. The deterministic capsule remains the
correctness boundary.

### 2.4 Keep recent control messages under pressure

The high-pressure `keep_recent / 2` behavior is useful for relief, but it can drop exactly the recent
status/control facts the model needs. Prefer one of:
- **Mirror-only approach**: keep halving unchanged, but mirror latest status/control facts into the
  capsule. This is the smallest diff.
- **Protected-control-tail approach**: when the tail contains `MotokoRuntimeStatus`, move the split
  boundary earlier to keep that status result in `recent` if doing so does not violate pair symmetry
  and does not erase projected relief below `min_relief_pct`.

Recommendation: ship mirror-only first. It preserves current relief behavior and is easier to test.

## 3. Work Items

### WI-1: control capsule builder

Files:
- `packages/motoko-ext-compaction-ai/compaction_ai.ail`

Changes:
- Replace `summary_msg(summary)` with a helper that accepts `ctx` and optional status facts.
- Thread `ctx` into the compacted message construction at `compact_with_ai`.
- Keep `summary_msg` content as a single assistant message with no tool calls, preserving compactor
  output shape.

Tests:
- Pure builder unit test with a hostile summary string like `"What would you like to work on?"`.
  This can call the capsule helper directly; the DST below covers the full `compact_with_ai` path
  through `summary_ports`.
- Assert the compacted output contains:
  - `[RUNTIME COMPACTION SUMMARY]`
  - `ORIGINAL TASK`
  - `not a fresh session`
  - `Continue the original task`
  - the exact `ctx.task`
- Update existing direct DST assertions that currently expect `[CONTEXT SUMMARY]`; after this change
  they should assert the new capsule header and cached AI prose, not the old wrapper.

### WI-2: prompt hardening

Files:
- `packages/motoko-ext-compaction-ai/compaction_ai.ail`

Changes:
- Extend `summarization_prompt` wording to ask for task objective, stop conditions, status/progress,
  next action, and "do not frame as fresh context".

Tests:
- Unit test can inspect the prompt indirectly only if a helper is exported or made testable. If not,
  keep this covered by direct source review and DST behavior.

### WI-3: latest status/control facts

Files:
- `packages/motoko-ext-compaction-ai/compaction_ai.ail`

Changes:
- Add a pure extractor over `[Msg]` that walks the transcript in order, remembers tool call ids from
  assistant messages where a call has `name == "MotokoRuntimeStatus"`, and records the latest matching
  tool message by `tool_call_id`.
- For MVP, extract by robust `contains`/substring-style helpers from the matched result, or copy a
  bounded excerpt from that tool message. Avoid fragile full JSON parsing unless local helpers make it
  simple.
- Include extracted facts or excerpt in `LATEST RUNTIME STATUS`.

Tests:
- Direct unit test with an old `MotokoRuntimeStatus` assistant call and matching tool result outside
  the preserved tail. Assert the final summary message still contains `current_step` / `step_budget`
  or the bounded status excerpt.
- Negative unit test or fixture shape: an unrelated tool result whose content happens to mention
  `MotokoRuntimeStatus` should not win over a properly correlated runtime-status result.

### WI-4: deterministic live-shape DST

Files:
- `scripts/long_qwen_compaction_dst.ail`

Changes:
- Add a direct compactor scenario using `summary_ports("What would you like to work on?")`.
- Use a task with explicit stop/control conditions. The current `direct_ctx(...)` helper hardcodes
  `task: "direct"`, so either add a `direct_ctx_with_task(...)` helper or extend `direct_ctx` to accept
  the task string before asserting exact task preservation.
- Assert `validate_compactor_output` still accepts the compacted segment and the summary capsule
  preserves the task/control fields.
- Keep validation scoped to the unpinned compaction segment passed to `compact_with_ai`. Do not call
  `validate_compactor_output` on a sealed payload that includes system messages; conformance rejects
  system messages in compactor output by design.
- Update the artifact-cache direct scenario so it checks that the cached AI prose is reused while the
  deterministic capsule is rebuilt from the current context. The conformance cache scenario uses the
  same context twice, so byte-identical output should still hold there.

Gate:
- `make compaction_dst`
- `make conformance`

---

## 4. Acceptance Criteria

- AI compaction output contains a deterministic control capsule on every `Compacted` path.
- A bad/weak summarizer cannot erase:
  - original task
  - "not a fresh session"
  - continue obligation
  - explicit stop/status cadence obligations
- Latest runtime status/progress is mirrored when available.
- Existing compactor invariants still pass:
  - system prefix preserved
  - tool pairing preserved
  - deterministic replay
  - artifact cache effective
- Latest live failure shape has a direct deterministic regression test.

Required gates:
- `make compaction_dst`
- `make conformance`

---

## 5. Non-Goals And Guardrails

- Do not change `src/core/step_machine.ail` stop finalization here. The stop guard is tracked by
  `.agent/issues/silent-empty-stop-finalize.md`.
- Do not change `src/core/session.ail` history persistence (`st.msgs` remains full/uncompacted).
- Do not change `src/core/compaction.ail` calibration.
- Do not make the summary cache persist compaction into retained history.
- Do not rely on the summarizer to obey the prompt for correctness.

---

## 6. Notes For Implementer

- `ctx.task` may be long. For live stress tasks, preserving it verbatim is valuable. If a cap is
  needed, cap from the end only after preserving the first sentence and any stop-condition lines.
- The live profile currently has `max_steps:100` while the stress prompt asks for 200
  (`.motoko/config/qwen36-compaction-live/config.json:5`). That mismatch should be fixed separately;
  do not hide it inside the compactor.
- A future rate-limit default change may reduce repeated AI compaction calls, but it does not remove
  the need for this capsule. Any compaction summary that replaces old control-bearing turns must
  preserve the control contract deterministically.
