# AILANG: `ailang test`'s cluster harness fails a passing test NON-DETERMINISTICALLY with `record has no field: <name>`

**Status:** **DOES NOT REPRODUCE on AILANG v0.33.0 (`ae36986`) — measured at WI-B4, 2026-08-04.**
Filed upstream 2026-08-04 as ticket `fb_2ad074d754cd2c25`, category `bug`; reproduced against the
v0.26.0 pin, **non-deterministic**, workaround applied. Not minimised to a standalone module — see
"What did not reproduce".

**The v0.33.0 measurement, and it is the same experiment as the two below.** WI-B2a cleared
`stub_step.live_ports`, which had blocked the probe module `src/core/dst_invariants.ail` since the
repin; WI-B2b deliberately deferred the retest wanting a clean run. Re-created identically — the same
one-line test with the same body appended to `dst_invariants.ail` — and run ten times:
**0 failures in 10**, against 6-in-10 on v0.26.0 measured twice independently. Each run reported
`9 tests: 9 passed` with `b4_probe_done_event_is_still_classified_logical_test_1` named and green,
so the probe RAN rather than being absent — checked, because absent and passing are the same
observation and this project has been caught by that difference four times. Source restored;
`dst_invariants.ail` is byte-identical to HEAD.

**Do not close it on this evidence alone.** 0-in-10 against a 60% base rate is strong (p ≈ 0.0001
under the old rate) but the defect was never minimised and its trigger was never understood, so
"fixed" and "perturbed out of reach by an unrelated change between v0.26.0 and v0.33.0" are not
distinguishable from here. The honest status is *not reproducing on the current pin*, and the
workaround comment in `Makefile` should stay until upstream says which it is.

**Independently re-reproduced before filing, at the same rate.** The workaround had removed the
trigger from the tree, so a reviewer re-created it: appended a one-line test with the same body to
`dst_invariants.ail`, ran `ailang test` ten times, and counted — **6 failures in 10**, matching this
note's measurement exactly, with the identical nested message
(`harness evaluation failed: harness evaluation failed: record has no field: site`). The source was
restored afterwards and `git diff` is clean. **Two independent 6-in-10 measurements is what made this
worth filing unminimised**: the rate itself is evidence, and the nested "harness evaluation failed"
gives whoever owns the harness a lead that does not require our closure.

Filed via the `ailang-feedback` skill's Channel 3, with the same trackability caveat as the other
tickets — see `ailang-no-warning-for-unreachable-match-arm.md`'s *How it was filed*.
**Pin:** AILANG v0.26.0 (`3b52a24`).
**Found:** WI-A14 piece 1, building `src/core/dst_invariants.ail`.
**Severity:** it fails in the good direction (a correct test is reported as failing), but it makes a
gate **flaky**, which is worse than a gate that is red — a flaky gate trains the reader to re-run
instead of to read.

## Symptom

An inline test whose entire body is one cross-module call fails with

```
✗ test_done_event_is_still_classified_logical_test_1
    harness evaluation failed: harness evaluation failed: record has no field: site
```

The body is:

```ailang
pure func test_done_event_is_still_classified_logical() -> bool
  tests [((), true)]
  {
    is_logical(event_vocabulary(), "DoneEvent")
  }
```

`site` is a field of no type this module declares, imports directly, or reaches from this call. It
belongs to `src/core/dst_profile`'s `CoreSite`, which is in the module's **transitive** closure
(`dst_invariants` → `dst_replay` → `dst_profile`).

`ailang check` is clean. Clearing `.ailang/cache` changes nothing. The failure is at evaluation time,
inside the test-cluster harness.

## It is non-deterministic, and that is the important part

Same source, same command, no cache change, ten consecutive runs:

```
$ for i in $(seq 10); do ailang test src/core/dst_invariants.ail </dev/null; done
```

**6 of 10 failed**, always the same test, always the same message. The other four passed with
`9 tests: 9 passed`.

Two controls, both stable over every trial:

| Command | Result |
|---|---|
| `ailang run --caps IO --entry main scripts/dst/invariants_dst.ail` — the *same* call, in a script | 6/6 pass |
| `ailang test src/core/dst_event_vocabulary.ail` — the callee's own module | 6/6 pass |

So it is not the expression, not the callee, and not `ailang` generally. It is `ailang test`'s
cluster harness on a module with this closure.

## Adjacent deterministic form, found first

Before the non-determinism was noticed, the same message appeared **deterministically** for a larger
conjunction in the same module, and the trigger looked like operand order:

| Test body | Result |
|---|---|
| `is_logical(rows, "DoneEvent")` alone | passes |
| `(not registered) && (not in_gap)` | passes |
| `is_logical(rows, "DoneEvent") && (not registered) && (not in_gap)` | **passes** |
| `(not registered) && is_logical(rows, "DoneEvent")` | **fails** |
| `(not in_gap) && is_logical(rows, "DoneEvent")` | **fails** |
| `(not registered) && (not in_gap) && is_logical(rows, "DoneEvent")` | **fails** |
| the same with the call `let`-bound first, then referenced | **fails** |

Given the non-determinism measured afterwards, "passes" in that table should be read as "passed on
the trials run", not as a stable classification. The one robust observation is that the failure
always names a record field from an unrelated module in the closure.

`let`-binding does not help, which distinguishes this from
[`ailang-record-update-field-call-is-not-a-dependency`](./ailang-record-update-field-call-is-not-a-dependency.md),
where `let`-binding is the fix.

## What did not reproduce

A reduced module — same imports (`dst_event_vocabulary`, `dst_replay`, `ports`, so the same
`dst_profile` in the closure), same test body, one test function — passed every trial. The trigger
needs something about the containing module, most likely how the harness groups multiple test
functions into an evaluation cluster; the error text says "harness evaluation failed" twice, nested,
which reads like a cluster wrapping a cluster.

Minimising that means bisecting nine test functions against a closure of fifteen modules **against a
6-in-10 failure rate**, where any single trial is uninformative. Not attempted; the workaround was
cheaper and is an improvement on its own terms.

## Workarounds applied

**1. Split conjunctions into one row per fact.** The original single test asserting three things
became three tests. Independently correct — cluster 12's rule is that a row should assert its own
fact so a red row names what broke — and it reduced the failure to one row.

**2. Move the surviving flaky assertion out of `tests` and into the acceptance script.** The
assertion is not weakened and not retried; it now runs under `ailang run` in
`scripts/dst/invariants_dst.ail`, where it is deterministic, and `make invariants` runs that. The
module carries a comment at the removal site pointing here and at the script row, so the assertion
cannot be assumed missing.

`make invariants` is now 5/5 green.

## Why it is worth filing despite not being minimal

The error text is actively misleading. The first fifteen minutes went into looking for a `site` field
that has nothing to do with the failure — it names an implementation detail of an unrelated module
in the closure. An error that said "internal harness error evaluating `<test name>`" would have been
routed correctly in one minute. That is a cheap fix upstream even if the underlying cause is not.
