#
# WI-C5's declared-versus-performed detector, out-of-process half.
# WI-D6 extended it from ONE binding of `on_budget_plan` to all FIFTEEN, and
# added a third producer because the second one has a blind spot the first
# fifteen subjects walked straight into.
#
# S16 requires the sides of a check to come from different producers and
# requires them NAMED at the site. There are now three:
#
#   DECLARED   grep of the effect row in packages/motoko-ext-abi/types.ail and
#              at every binding site. A static annotation a human wrote.
#              Produced HERE, in this shell, from source text.
#
#   PERFORMED  the exit status of `ailang run --caps <row minus X>` against
#   (runtime)  scripts/dst/declared_vs_performed.ail. The AILANG interpreter
#              traps a capability only when an effect operation is actually
#              evaluated, so a completed run witnesses that the operation was
#              not evaluated. Produced by the RUNTIME, in a separate process.
#              A WITNESS OVER THE PATH THE ARM EXERCISES — not a proof.
#
#   PERFORMED  the exit status of `ailang check` over a binding carrying the
#   (static)   narrowed row. The effect checker rejects a body that performs
#              more than its row admits, over ALL inputs. Produced by the
#              COMPILER. Added at WI-D6, and it is what settles the EIGHT
#              subjects the runtime producer cannot reach — see THE CONFOUND.
#
# No two of them derive from each other: the annotation is what a human wrote,
# the trap is what the interpreter did, the rejection is what the type checker
# inferred from the body.
#
# ============================================================================
# THE CONFOUND, and why every runtime subject is a PAIR of arms
# ============================================================================
#
# `register_with_config` is not effect-free for most extension packages: nine
# of fifteen read `Env` at registration (a `getEnvOr` for a workdir or profile
# directory) and seven of those also read `FS` (a config file, or a portability
# gate probing for a marker file). Those reads happen BEFORE any hook is
# dispatched.
#
# So the naive arm — install, dispatch, capability withheld — dies for nine of
# fifteen subjects, and every one of those deaths would be scored as "the hook
# performs Env". That is a FALSE POSITIVE in the direction that blocks the
# narrowing, and nothing in the exit status distinguishes it from the real
# thing.
#
# Hence the differential. Each extension has TWO arms run under the SAME
# withheld capabilities, and the runner reads the PAIR:
#
#   reg completes, budget completes  -> the HOOK performs neither. MEASURED.
#   reg completes, budget dies       -> the HOOK performs it.      BLOCKING.
#   reg dies                         -> registration performed it first; the
#                                       hook was never reached.    CONFOUNDED.
#
# THE PAIR DISCIPLINE for the vacuity controls is C5's and is unchanged: a
# subject completing with a capability withheld is meaningless unless the
# withholding is demonstrably real, so the control must die WITH THE NAMED
# CAPABILITY in its error. A control that dies for an unrelated reason would
# make the subject's completion read as evidence when it is noise. WI-D6 hit
# exactly that while building the compile-time control: the first mutant failed
# on `undefined variable: getEnvOr` rather than on the effect row, and would
# have certified nothing.

# carrying an AILANG fence. It reaches a capability the other input never asks
# for, and dies. Asserting this is what stops the non-inline row's green from
# being read as a claim about the HOOK rather than about the hook AND ITS INPUT."
# The capability had already moved once — WI-D19 routed the five FS sites and the
# arm stopped dying on FS and started dying on Process. That block ended with a
# prediction:
#
#     "So this row is now also the standing witness for that unrouted seam: the

# was built to detect exactly this event and it detected it, red, on the first
# run after the routing landed.
#
# WHAT REPLACES IT IS THE STRONGER CLAIM, not a weaker one. The old row asserted
# that ONE ambient capability was still reachable; this one asserts that NONE is.
# `compose_intercept_inline` runs under the base withheld set — Env, FS AND

# WI-D25: THE TWO AUDITED SLOTS' CAPABILITY BOUNDS, AS COMPILER VERDICTS
# ============================================================================
#
# The goal line's disclosure table needs each slot's REACHABLE SURFACE stated
# with a measured reason, and the effect checker answers it totally: a port call
# type-checks in a hook body exactly when the port's row is INCLUDED in the
# slot's row. That is a different question from "does the slot's row contain the
# effect", and WI-D24 answered the second while writing the first —
# `on_solver_candidate` declares `! {Process}` and WI-D24 concluded it "reaches
# the seam", which is S33's shape: a proxy (the effect is present) standing in
# for the truth (the whole row is admitted). `proc_exec` demands
# `{IO, Process, FS}` and gets one of three.
#
# So the bound is asserted the only way that cannot be inferred wrong: a probe
# the compiler REJECTS beside one it ACCEPTS, per slot, plus the widened control
# that attributes each rejection to the row rather than to a malformed call.
#
#   on_pre_step        ! {AI, IO, Trace}  ai_step   ACCEPT   (the one field)
#                                         clock_now REJECT   (needs Clock)
#   on_solver_candidate ! {Process}       proc_exec REJECT   (needs IO, FS too)
#                                         std/process.exec ACCEPT (AMBIENT)
#
# The last row is the one that says what the slot CAN do, and it is why the
# narrowed claim in `ext/runtime.decide_one_finalize` is "ambient subprocess
# only" rather than "no subprocess": `context_mode`'s binding spawns a `node`
# bridge through `std/process.exec` today, unmediated, and no ExtPorts widening
# is involved.
#
# THE SIGNATURE IS `(ExtCtx, string) -> int` ON EVERY PROBE and the slots' real
# arities are not reproduced, for the same reason `control_pair` above does not:
# effect checking is a property of the BODY against the ROW, and the parameter
# list and return type take no part in it. What is faithful here is the row and
