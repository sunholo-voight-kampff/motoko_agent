QWEN36_COMPACTION_LIVE_TASK ?= Run a long tool-heavy compaction calibration task that repeatedly grows conversation history and continues after compaction.
QWEN36_COMPACTION_HEAVY_TASK ?= Run a compaction stress calibration. Do not stop early. Perform at least 1000 sequential tool-heavy phases. In each phase, read several large source files or documentation files in full, run broad searches over the repository, and keep a running phase log in your response. Prefer files under src/, packages/, .agent/projects/, scripts/, and design_docs/. After every 5 phases, restate the important accumulated findings so far. Continue until you have made at least 1000 model turns or until the runtime compacts. If context pressure or compaction occurs, continue the task and explicitly report that you continued after it. STEP-GATE (mandatory): After EVERY ordinary tool call you make (ReadFile, Search, WriteFile, EditFile, BashExec, RunTests, and any Ctx* or exa_* extension tool), you MUST immediately also call the MotokoRuntimeStatus tool in the same response/turn. Inspect its returned 'current_step' (number of steps executed so far) and 'step_budget'. If current_step is still below the target steps, you MUST continue: do NOT stop, do NOT emit a final-only prose answer, and do NOT declare the task complete. Instead, make further tool calls (read more files, run more searches, keep the running phase log) and advance to the next step. Only when current_step has reached the target of 1000 steps (or the runtime reports compaction) may you emit a final summary. Treat the MotokoRuntimeStatus step count as the authoritative progress indicator and keep calling it until the target is met; never assume you are finished based on a round count of phases alone.

# ADR-001 D1's substrate gate (WI-C2), asserted clause by clause.
#
# D1 requires, before streaming trace parity can be claimed and therefore before
# the DST name is earned, that the recorded-stream API be PINNED and a direct
# positive version of the spike prove five properties: immediate projection,
# exact returned-log parity, success, partial-stream-then-error, and no
# duplicate delivery. Five clauses, five rows — a conjunction that passes says
# nothing about which clause held.
#
# WHY THIS TARGET CANNOT USE --ai-stub, which every other target here does.
# Measured, not assumed: the stub is a provider WITHOUT native streaming, so per
# std/ai's own contract it fires the callback exactly twice — one
# ContentDelta(full_text), one Usage — and it always returns Ok. On two chunks,
# ordering is barely exercised and duplication not at all; partial-
# stream-then-error cannot be produced at all. A stub-driven pass would look
# identical to a real one in the output, which is the shape this milestone
# exists to stop. The target therefore stands up a real native SSE endpoint on
# loopback and points AILANG's OpenAI provider at it via OPENAI_BASE_URL.
#
# It needs python3 and a free loopback port ($$PORT, default 8819). No network
# egress and no API key: OPENAI_API_KEY is a literal placeholder the fixture
# server ignores.

# ADR-001 D6.4's stream-parity obligation (WI-C3), held on a RUN.
#
# TWO GATES, and they cover different halves — the split is measured rather than
# claimed, and it is the item's main finding.
#
#   1. `stream_parity_dst.ail`. The first thing in the tree that drives the real
#      driver, bridges what it returns into an `ExecutionUnderTest`
#      (`src/core/dst_execution.execution_of`), and evaluates all sixteen D7
#      families over it. Before WI-C3 the whole suite had ONE construction site,
#      a hand-authored fixture. Both sides of the parity comparison derive from
#      `ProviderExchange.emissions`, because that is the only in-process
#      observation of the stream, so what this proves is that the driver carries
#      the trace and the emission witness forward TOGETHER on every branch after
#      the provider call.
#   2. `run_stream_parity_wire.sh`. The wire against the trace. The wire is what
#      the CALLBACK projected during the call; the trace is what the driver
#      APPENDED from the log the provider returned. Different producers, so this
#      is the half D6.4 actually names — and it is the only one that can see a
#      projection which disagrees with the returned log.
#
# MEASURED: a de-duplication injected into `append_stream_delta` — the callback
# dropping adjacent repeats — leaves gate 1 fully GREEN and turns gate 2 red on
# count, order and fixture adequacy. Neither gate subsumes the other, and gate 1
# alone would ship a green check over the defect D6.4 exists to find.

#
# TWO PRODUCERS, named as S16 requires: the wire is written by `ledger_emit` at
# the site the event happened; the returned trace is written by `ledger_append`
# in the driver and printed after the run. In process both derive from one bound
# value, which is why the comparison is here and not in the .ail suite — WI-C3

# green over a wire that was leaking ten retries.
#
# THE COUPLING THAT MAKES THE REGISTER REAL: the required set is

# The sweep. Every target below is independent of every other -- the one

#
# ORDERED LONGEST-FIRST, and the order is load-bearing rather than cosmetic.
# make hands work out in listed order, so a long target listed late starts late
# and stretches the makespan past the point where the short ones have drained.
# Measured serially at v0.33.0 (seconds): test_coverage 214, declared_vs_
# performed 75, terminal_trace 74, smoke_parity 45, profile_definition 31,
# smoke_driver 26, corpus_pr 23, strict_replay 21, world_state 19; the remaining
# 32 are under 16 each and 30 of them are under 10. Four targets are 60% of the
# sweep. Re-derive after adding a target that lands near the top -- an
# out-of-place SHORT target costs nothing, an out-of-place LONG one costs its
# own runtime.
#
# THE CACHE LANES BELOW ARE WHAT MAKE THE PARALLELISM PAY. AILANG writes its
# compile cache to `<dir-of-root-source>/.ailang/cache/compile/`, so without
# them every `scripts/dst/*.ail` target shares ONE cache directory, and
# `CacheStore.Save()` (ailang internal/pipeline/cache_store.go) rewrites the
# WHOLE manifest with a plain os.WriteFile -- no lock, no temp+rename. N
# concurrent processes therefore erase each other's freshly-cached modules and
# the cache degrades toward cold as N rises. `AILANG_CACHE_DIR` is AILANG's own
# documented remedy for exactly this. Measured end to end on 8 cores: 688s
# serial, 329s at -j8 sharing the cache, 289s at -j8 with lanes, 196s once
# test_coverage's inner fan-out is unblocked too (3.5x).
#
# This is a THROUGHPUT change and never a verdict change: AILANG's cache key is
# content-addressed over (format version, compiler version, source hash, dep
# interface digests) with no compile flags, so concurrent writers write
# byte-identical artifacts and a torn read fails its decode and falls through to
# a recompile. The race has always cost time and never an answer.

# D5's profile-DEFINITION and EXECUTION-MANIFEST machinery (WI-A10). Three

#      rejected BY ITS RULE, each one mutated a single field away from a
#      definition that loads clean — so an unrelated rule firing means the
#      mutation did something other than what the label says. Plus the NEGATIVE
#      CONTROL, which is load-bearing rather than decorative: a validator that
#      only ever rejects passes a suite of only-rejecting fixtures.
#
#   2. A STRUCTURAL GUARD that the definition still carries all ten D5 fields.
#      The record is hand-written and dropping a field is a compile error only
#      at construction sites — so a field could be removed together with its
#      check and every fixture would still pass, which is an artifact that
#      validates while incomplete.
#
#   3. THE ANTI-TRANSCRIPTION GUARD. Classifier 2's sets are derived from the
#      SOURCE by a Python tool, so they enter the AILANG fixtures as literals,
#      and a literal is what goes stale silently. check_fixtures.py re-derives
#      them and fails if the AILANG side disagrees — including the check that
#      every installable extension the tool found calling a classifier-2 field
#      is named in the fixture, and (once the profile lands) omitted by name.
#
# Everything else this machinery needs is READ at runtime from the artifact that
# computed it — the seven/one dispatch split from A6, the table identity from
# A5, each waiver's condition from A7, the vocabulary version from A8 — because
# the characteristic defect of composition is re-deriving a fact an input

#      checks that every installable extension the call inventory finds calling

#      extension calls a state-threading seam, this goes red instead of the

#
# NOTE the intended failure mode: the attribution reference is recorded as
# LITERALS, so correcting the attribution table turns this target RED until
# `driver_only` is re-issued with a version bump. That is D4's rule — a table
# correction re-issues every referring profile — and it is only mechanically
# true if the profile records the content hash and something compares it. If
# this goes red after a table edit, bump `driver_only_version` and re-record the

# D2's execution program and its pure structural validator (WI-A13, stage 1).
#
# The acceptance script is MUTATION-BASED: one valid program, one change each,
# and every row asserts the specific RULE its change violates rather than merely
# a non-empty rejection list. A guard that is deleted or weakened in one
# direction turns exactly its own row red — verified by deliberately removing
# the duplicate-ordinal guard, by dropping one direction of the deadline rule,
# and by rewriting the duplicate rule to compare identity BODIES.
#
# The last of those is why the base program contains a RETRY: interactions #1
# and #8 carry a byte-identical tool identity at different ordinals. D2 requires
# a repeated production call id to stay representable "so an invariant can
# reject them as system behavior rather than the program decoder rejecting the
# artifact". Rejecting duplicate bodies type-checks, passes every mutant row,
# and silently makes the retry artifact undecodable — the NEGATIVE CONTROL is
# the only thing that catches it. If you tighten the duplicate rule and this
# goes red, the rule is what is wrong, not the fixture.

# WI-A13 stage 2: discovery against `driver_only`. Four checks, in order.
#
#   1. The acceptance script. Two scenarios (`approve`, `deny`), each carrying
#      the two-sided balance, the identity-CONTENT comparisons, seven mutation
#      rows, the vacuity control, determinism, and stage 1's structural
#      validator run over the recorded log.
#
#   2. THE WIRE WITNESS, and it is the strongest evidence in this stage. The
#      driver emits `provider_call_prepared` (session.ail, before the
#      dispatch_step call) and `v2_tool_dispatch_start` (tool_phase.ail, before
#      the port calls) to the wire through ledger_emit. Neither is appended to
#      the returned ledger trace, so no AILANG assertion can read them —
#      cluster 4 measured that same emit/append imbalance. This step captures
#      the JSONL and compares it against the census the recorder printed. Two
#      authors, two records, one execution: it is what makes the tool class's
#      completeness an oracle rather than the recorder grading itself.
#
#      `--entry wire_witness` performs exactly ONE run so the comparison is
#      exact equality with nothing to keep in sync.
#
#   3. THE ENV CLASS'S SOURCE DERIVATION. The env class has no runtime witness
#      at all — `ports.env_get` is a keyed lookup and emits no ledger event — so
#      its completeness is asserted against the keys the DRIVER'S SOURCE can
#      read. This step re-derives that set from the `ports.env_get(` call sites
#      and diffs it against `driver_env_keys()`. The literal is checked, never
#      trusted: a source-derived set nobody re-derives is a stale literal, and
#      then the env class's only evidence is the recorder's own word.
#
#      This is PROVENANCE evidence, not capability evidence. A13's report and
#      D11's counters must not add it into one completeness number with the six
#      classes that have runtime witnesses.
#
#   4. The checker's own unit tests, including its negative control and both
#      over-recording directions.
#
# The env grep is anchored to the SYNTACTIC FORM `.env_get(<world>, "KEY"` and
# not to a bare key name — cluster 7's correction 1. A guard that greps a bare
# token eventually fires on the artifact documenting it, because these items are
# required to write prose naming what they check.
#
# The receiver is deliberately unanchored. The first version of this grep
# required `ports.env_get(`, and it silently missed session.ail's
# MOTOKO_CAPTURE_FAILED_PAYLOAD read, which goes through `st.provider.env_get(`.
# The derivation caught that itself on its first run — which is the argument for
# deriving rather than declaring, made by the derivation. A key literal is
# required, so session.ail's extension-bridge closure (whose key is a variable
# supplied by an extension) correctly does not match.
# WI-D26: the LIVE half of the routed subprocess seam, and it is a SEPARATE
# target from `discovery` on S14's grounds rather than for convenience.
#
# `discovery`'s `compose_check_scenario` drives compose's routed `check_snippet`
# against a scripted `ext_effects` entry. That establishes the ADOPTION — the
# branch on the typed code, the identity, the round trip — and establishes
# nothing about whether the seam can run a compiler at all, because in a
# scripted world it runs none. WI-D19 shipped exactly that gap in the other
# direction (its note claimed `proc_exec` could not reach `ailang`, which was
# true of the tool NAME it tried and false of the seam), and WI-D21 needed a
# separate measurement to find it.
#
# So this target runs one real `ailang check` through the production bridge over
# `live_ports` and asserts the COMPILER's own wording comes back. It is the row
# that cannot be satisfied by a stub, by a tool-error blob, or by a seam that
# returns "requires extension capability".
#
# It is NOT under `--ai-stub`: nothing here calls a provider. `--caps AI` is
# present only because `register_with_config`'s row declares it, and the runtime
# prints an advisory about the missing model that no code path reaches.

# WI-A13 stage 3: strict replay against `driver_only`. Four checks, in order.
#
#   1. The acceptance script. Two scenarios — `rich`, which is the fixture that
#      must SURVIVE and carries every shape D2 protects with no two of its
#      quantities equal (S7), and `maxsteps`, which ends in `Err` so the
#      Err-surviving witnesses are exercised on the path where the returned
#      message list is empty. Each carries the refusal rules, the manifest
#      check, the two-sided reconstitution balance, the replay comparison, seven
#      single-position mutation rows, the typed HarnessFailure, determinism, and
#      — the axis that makes this stage more than a restatement of itself — the
#      replayed run graded against witnesses the recorder did not write, plus
#      the tautology control that proves the grading is load-bearing.
#
#      Stage 5 adds axis J: D2's REGRESSION mode over those same five mutated
#      logs, which must record two of them and stay fatal on the other five.
#      Both modes read one set of inputs on purpose — a regression mode given
#      its own quietly different fixtures could disagree with strict mode for
#      reasons that have nothing to do with the demotion set.
#
#   2. THE WIRE WITNESS. `v2_tool_dispatch_start` (tool_phase.ail) is emitted
#      BEFORE the port calls and `provider_call_prepared` (session.ail) is
#      emitted separately from the dispatch call. Neither is appended to the
#      returned trace — session.ail hands tool_phase a bare
#      `\event. ledger_emit(...)` — so no AILANG assertion can read them.
#      `--entry wire_witness` performs exactly ONE discovery run and ONE replay
#      of its program, and this step compares the wire's totals against the sum
#      of the two censuses. NO MULTIPLIER: a sum over the runs that actually
#      happened cannot go stale when a scenario is added elsewhere.
#
#      It also asserts the two censuses are EQUAL, which is strict replay's own
#      claim restated on the wire's terms — by production code that knows
#      nothing about the interaction log.
#
#   3. THE CODEC TESTS. `world_state_of` reconstitutes the provider script and
#      the tool queue from recorded payloads, so a codec whose encoder and
#      decoder disagree about a field produces a replay that serves a different
#      response while every count still balances. The round trips are in
#      ports.ail because that is where both halves live.
#
#   4. dst_replay's own units: the walk, the outcome projection and the
#      reconstitution balance, each shown to fire AND to stay quiet.

# D2's SEEDED GENERATOR (WI-A13 stage 4). Three checks:
#
#   1. The acceptance script. Ten axes over five honest generated runs and three
#      seed-ignoring mutant runs — seed sensitivity, the mutant, the generator
#      actually being consulted, the declared bounds in both directions, stage
#      1's validator and stage 3's strict replay over generated programs, S7's
#      two obligations, the C5 mutations and determinism.
#
#   2. dst_generator's own units, which are where the seed-sensitivity RULE is
#      asserted against hand-built row sets — including a seed-ignoring one that
#      must go red, written and run before a line of the generator existed (S1).
#      Stage 5 adds D8's GENERATOR CANARY here: pinned rows per generator id and
#      version that go red if the seed-to-choices mapping moves without a
#      version bump. The pins are hand-written literals and there is NO target
#      that refreshes them — that is the point, not an omission. A red canary is
#      a decision: bump `generator_version` and re-pin by hand so a reviewer
#      reads the diff, or fix the generator.
#
#   3. THE SEEDROW COMPARISON, out of process. The one result this stage exists
#      to produce — different seeds produce different programs — is re-derived
#      HERE from the script's own emitted rows, by a second author that cannot
#      share a defect with the in-process comparison. Three things are checked
#      and each is a different way for the claim to be hollow:
#
#        * two rows with DIFFERENT seeds have different digests (the claim);
#        * two rows with the SAME seed have the SAME digest (reproducibility,
#          without which "different" is just noise);
#        * the equal-count pair really does have equal interaction counts, so
#          the difference above cannot be a difference in program LENGTH. A
#          count is blind to two programs of equal length and different
#          contents, which is how cluster 9's site 19 stayed hidden through
#          every count-shaped gate in this suite.
#
#      The greps below are anchored to the emitted line's syntactic form
#      (`^SEEDROW <label> seed=`), not to a bare token. A bare-token guard
#      eventually fires on the artifact that documents it, which is what kept
#      `make world_state` red for two clusters.

# D8's PERSISTENCE OBLIGATIONS (WI-A13 stage 6). Six checks.
#
#   1. The acceptance script. The negative control first — an honest synthetic
#      program survives the detector and redaction of it is the identity — then
#      the driver's own environment surface, the per-shape mutation rows, the
#      rule-coverage row, the interaction sites, and D8's reject-or-redact
#      tension reported rather than decided silently. Then the encoding: the
#      specimen's shape coverage, the field-by-field round trip, determinism and
#      diffability as NUMBERS, the frozen v1 artifact, the fail-closed unknown
#      schema, thirteen decode mutation rows, the ordering obligation read off
#      the file system, the store's collision refusal, and regression replay
#      over the program decoded from the frozen bytes.
#
#   2. dst_secrets's own units. This is where the detectors' FALSE-POSITIVE
#      controls live, and they are the load-bearing half: every manifest this
#      project persists carries a git revision and every artifact carries a
#      sha256 digest, both of which are long unbroken runs in the credential
#      alphabet. A detector that scores them refuses every honest program while
#      looking like it is working.
#
#   3. THE STD-ONLY TIER GUARD, below. `dst_secrets` may import std and
#      `dst_interaction` and nothing else, and that is a structural property
#      rather than a tidiness preference: WI-A14 records interaction artifacts
#      at the port seam, and `src/core/ports.ail` cannot import a module that
#      names `ExecutionManifest` without dragging the whole 1559-line
#      `dst_profile` closure into the PRODUCTION driver's import graph. Stage 2
#      moved `Interaction` down for exactly this reason; an import added here
#      makes the redactor unreachable from the place it is needed, and nothing
#      else in the build would notice until A14 tried.
#
#      The grep is anchored to the syntactic form `^import ` rather than to a
#      module name, so it cannot be satisfied by renaming and cannot fire on
#      prose that mentions a module (cluster 7's correction 1).
#   4. THE MANIFEST ARITY GUARD. `ExecutionManifest` has sixteen fields and the
#      codec must write and read all sixteen. A field added in `dst_profile` and
#      forgotten in `required_header_tags()`/`repeatable_header_tags()` would be
#      silently absent from every artifact: the encoder would not write it, the
#      decoder would not miss it, and both halves type-check. That is S7's
#      record-level form, and it is the defect this whole stage exists to
#      prevent — so it is counted from `dst_profile`'s own declaration rather
#      than trusted to a literal, exactly as the ProfileDefinition guard above
#      counts A10's.
#
#   5. THE FROZEN SPECIMEN GUARD. `scripts/dst/fixtures/execution-program-v1.artifact`
#      is the compatibility policy. There is deliberately NO target that
#      regenerates it — no --update, no ACCEPT=1 — because the encoder and the
#      decoder were written in the same commit and agree by construction, so
#      every round-trip row would pass against a policy that exists only as
#      prose. This guard checks the file is present and non-trivial, so that
#      deleting it turns the gate red instead of turning the frozen row vacuous.
#      If the acceptance row goes red, the two permitted responses are to keep a
#      v1 decode path or to bump the schema version and pin a runner. Rewriting
#      the file is the one response that is not available.
#
#   6. THE NO-REGENERATION GUARD. Nothing in the tree may write to the fixtures
#      directory. This is the guard that keeps check 5 honest: a convenience
#      entry point that refreshes the specimen becomes a habit, and the first
#      person to hit a red compatibility row will use it. The one that produced
#      these bytes was deleted after use, which is stage 5's discipline for its
#      canary pins applied to an artifact instead of a table.

# compose's `register_with_config` reads Env and then FS before any hook is

# D3's fault catalogue (WI-A7). Three checks:

#      adopted the strings tool_phase already emitted, so the only thing worth

# D6's event vocabulary, the fifth recorded axis (WI-A8). Four checks:
#
#   1. The round trip. All 34 LedgerEvent variants — and BOTH StreamDelta
#      branches, since that is the one variant whose wire name is a function of
#      the payload — are projected through the live to_schema_v1 and compared
#      against the artifact's declared wire name AND payload schema. Checking
#      only the name would leave the payload schema decorative prose.
#
#   2. THREE STRUCTURAL GUARDS, because the artifact's completeness cannot be
#      made a compile error on the pin. AILANG has no constructor enumeration,
#      so a 35th LedgerEvent variant would force an arm in event_variant_id
#      (which is a total match) but could be left out of the row list AND out of
#      the sample list, and every check above would still pass — an artifact
#      that validates while incomplete. The guards tie all three lists to the
#      TYPE DECLARATION rather than to each other:
#
#        variants in `export type LedgerEvent`   == rows in event_vocabulary()
#        rows in event_vocabulary()              == variants with a golden
#
#      The second also keeps the BYTE-level pinning total: the goldens in
#      phase_vocab cover all 34 today, and this is what stops a new variant
#      entering the vocabulary without one.
#
#   3. The vocabulary's own unit tests and phase_vocab's goldens.
#
# NOTE for anyone editing src/core/dst_event_vocabulary.ail: guard 2 counts
# `variant: "` inside the body of `event_vocabulary()`. Writing that string in
# prose inside that function turns this gate red for no reason — the same shape
# as terminal_trace's `{ result:` counter over session.ail.
# WI-C4 REPAIR, AND IT IS A GATE DEFECT RATHER THAN A CONTENT ONE. Six recipes
# in this file ran their unit suite as `ailang test X > /dev/null && echo "✓ X"`
# in NON-TERMINAL position. Under `set -e` a failure on the left of `&&` does
# not exit, and the status is discarded by the following `;` — so the target
# printed no tick for that file and exited 0. Terminal-position uses of the same
# form are safe (the recipe's status is the last command's), which is why this
# survived: eleven of seventeen sites were fine and the pattern read as uniform.
# Measured at WI-C4: of the six swallowing sites exactly one was masking a real
# failure — `dst_event_vocabulary`'s `test_logical_gap_is_recorded`, red since
# WI-C3 flipped `StreamDelta.reaches_trace_today` without updating its pinned
# literal. Two items reported "every target but two passes" over it. All six now
# run as checked commands.

# D7's whole-execution invariant set (WI-A14 piece 1). Three checks, and the
# structural ones exist for the reason every hand-written set in this project
# has one: AILANG has no constructor enumeration on the pin, so a set can grow
# a member that no list knows about and every check still passes — an artifact
# that validates while incomplete.
#
#   1. THE SUITE. One fixture that must SURVIVE (S7, both halves executable),
#      then a single-field mutation per rule, each asserting ITS OWN rule rather
#      than a non-empty finding list. Cluster 12 measured why that matters: a
#      row asserting "some finding" is green on the wrong evidence, and two
#      rows here caught exactly that during construction — a stream-parity
#      check that compared tags and not content, and a retry mutant that was
#      tripping `record-after-terminal` instead.
#
#   2. TWO STRUCTURAL GUARDS, both anchored to a SYNTACTIC form (the `= X` /
#      `| X` constructor lines of the type declaration itself) rather than to a
#      count written down somewhere:
#
#        variants in `export type InvariantFamily` == all_families()      (12)
#        variants in `export type Violation`       == sample_violations() (37)
#
#      The second is the load-bearing one. `violation_rule`, `violation_family`
#      and `violation_message` are total matches, so a new rule is a compile
#      error in all three — but a new rule left out of `sample_violations()`
#      would never be checked for a distinct id, a family, or a message that
#      names it, and the suite would be green while the artifact was incomplete.
#
#   3. The module's own unit tests, which carry the parity pins: the register
#      equals the vocabulary's gap in both directions, and the display-only set
#      is the pinned six. Those two are what make D6.4's one-line wrong answer
#      — reclassify the gap as DisplayOnly — loud instead of merely discouraged.
#
# NOTE for anyone editing src/core/dst_invariants.ail: the guards count lines
# matching `^  [|=]` between the type header and the following blank line. A
# constructor wrapped onto a continuation line, or a blank line inside the
# declaration, changes the count without changing the type — the same shape as
# event_vocabulary's `variant: "` counter.

# D11's run report and its counters (WI-A14 piece 3). Four checks.
#
#   1. THE SUITE. A complete report that must SURVIVE — a gate built only from
#      rejecting fixtures passes on a validator that rejects unconditionally —
#      then one single-field mutant per rejection rule, each asserting its own.
#
#   2. TWO STRUCTURAL GUARDS anchored to the syntactic form of the type
#      declarations:
#
#        variants in `export type ReachStatus`    == all_reach_ids()      (5)
#        variants in `export type ReportRejection` == sample_rejections() (13)
#
#      ReachStatus is the load-bearing one. Cluster 12's finding is that the
#      three unreached fault classes are unreached in three DIFFERENT ways and a
#      merged "unreached" number reports three facts as one — so the statuses
#      are a sum with a reason each, and a sixth added without an id would let a
#      fourth kind of gap be silently counted as one of the existing three.
#
#   3. THE ENTRY POINT THE REPLAY COMMAND NAMES MUST EXIST. `replay_command`
#      renders a copy-pasteable line into CI output (D8), and a command naming
#      an entry point nobody wrote satisfies every AILANG-side check while being
#      unpasteable — the same shape as D8's forbidden "digest without retained
#      bytes": a reference that looks like one and is not. The grep is anchored
#      to the syntactic form `export func <name>(` rather than to the bare name,
#      so a mention in a comment does not satisfy it.
#
#   4. AND THE COMMAND IS ACTUALLY RUN, against the frozen v1 specimen. Check 3
#      proves the entry point exists; only running it proves it loads retained
#      bytes. D8's clause is about replayability, and an affordance nobody
#      executes is exactly the kind of claim this project keeps finding green
#      and empty.

# D4's latency pair (WI-A14 piece 2). Two checks.
#
#   1. THE SUITE. Two worlds identical but for one integer, run through the REAL
#      driver, demonstrating completion versus timeout; the S8 control (same
#      latency, no declared deadline, must COMPLETE); both programs replaying
#      deterministically; and the two artifacts having different identities, so
#      the pair is two programs rather than one reported twice.
#
#   2. A WIRE WITNESS, and it is here for the same reason strict_replay's is.
#      Every assertion in the AILANG suite reads the INTERACTION LOG, which the
#      recorder wrote — so a recorder that stamped `ToolDeadlineExceeded` on
#      both halves would satisfy all of them. `native_tool_results` carries the
#      fault class to the wire from PRODUCTION code (tool_phase's
#      tool_outcome_message) that knows nothing about the interaction log, and
#      it must appear exactly as many times as the run has slow halves.
#
#      The suite runs the slow world THREE times (the pair, the replay pair, and
#      the identity check) and the fast world three times, so the wire carries
#      three deadline faults and no more. Counted rather than grepped for
#      presence: presence is satisfied by a recorder that faults everything.

# D11's BLOCKING PR CORPUS (WI-A15 commit 1). Four checks.
#
#   1. THE SUITE. The twelve pinned seeds plus the constructed member, each
#      generated by the real driver, persisted, LOADED BACK off disk and keyed
#      on both corpus keys; the collective coverage obligation; the shrink-only
#      register asserted in both directions; and one single-field mutant per
#      rejection rule, each asserting ITS OWN rule.
#
#   2. THE BRANCH COUNTER, AND IT CANNOT LIVE IN THE SUITE. D11 keeps
#      class-reached and branch-reached as separate counters because reaching a
#      class is not evidence that the production branch ran. Every assertion in
#      the AILANG suite reads the INTERACTION LOG, which the recorder wrote — so
#      a recorder that stamped a class on everything would satisfy all of them.
#
#      The branch witness is the WIRE, and it is not reachable from inside the
#      process at all: `NativeToolDenied` and `NativeToolResults` are both in
#      `dst_invariants.d64_gap_register()`, so they never reach the returned
#      trace. Production code emits them knowing nothing about the interaction
#      log. Each of the five branches is COUNTED rather than grepped for
#      presence, because presence is satisfied by a driver that denies
#      everything.
#
#      `empty_stop_finalize` is the sharpest of the five: exactly ONE across the
#      whole target, emitted by the constructed member alone. A second one would
#      mean a generated seed had started reaching the class the construction
#      exists for, which is the register-closing event the suite's
#      `constructed-for-reachable-class` rule is about.
#
#   3. TWO STRUCTURAL GUARDS, anchored to the syntactic form of the type
#      declarations and checking membership BY NAME rather than by count —
#      cluster 13's finding, and it is why: `CorpusEmpty` and `WindowZero` are
#      NULLARY, and a regex keyed on `Constructor(` silently misses every
#      constructor without arguments.
#
#   4. THE MEASURED CI COST IS ITSELF GATED. D11 delegates seed counts to
#      measured cost and the plan selects them here; a measured constant nobody
#      re-measures is the stale number this project keeps finding. The target's
#      wall clock is compared against `pr_target_ceiling_ms()` read out of the
#      source, so the measurement that the minimums are derived from has a gate
#      behind it rather than a comment.

# D11's SCHEDULED ROTATING CORPUS (WI-A15 commit 2). Six checks.
#
#   1. THE SUITE. The rotation checked three non-redundant ways — position by
#      position, the wrap branch, and the epoch's route — plus the shard
#      partition and the demo scale's contract.
#
#   2. THE JOB IS RUN FOR REAL, at the demo scale, off a window derived from an
#      epoch. Everything in check 1 is pure arithmetic and would pass over a
#      window whose seeds no driver can execute.
#
#   3. AND THE FOUR FAILURES ARE FORCED, NOT ASSERTED. D11: "A zero, silently
#      truncated, or below-minimum window fails", plus the epoch's own
#      fail-closed. A gate asserting "no member failed" is green on a window
#      that ran NO members — zero failures out of zero runs — so each condition
#      is injected into the REAL JOB and the job must exit non-zero.
#
#      This is A16's clause earning its keep a second time: "verified by
#      breaking one deliberately" could not be satisfied there as written,
#      because four of eight scripts had no failing exit path at all and would
#      have been wired in green regardless of their assertions.
#
#   4. THE ENTRY POINT THE WORKFLOW NAMES MUST EXIST, anchored to the syntactic
#      form `export func <name>(` rather than the bare name, so a mention in a
#      comment does not satisfy it. Same guard as `make run_report`'s, and for
#      the same reason: a workflow naming an entry point nobody wrote passes
#      every AILANG-side check while never running.
#
#   5. THE WORKFLOW MUST NOT SELECT THE DEMO SCALE. The demo scale is why check
#      2 is affordable; a scheduled job that quietly selected it would report a
#      rotating corpus while searching four seeds. That is the frozen-window
#      failure wearing a smaller number, and nothing inside the AILANG process
#      can see it.
#
#   6. THE MATRIX WIDTH MUST EQUAL THE DECLARED SHARD COUNT, both read from
#      source. A matrix wider than `scheduled_job().shards` runs workers whose
#      shard index selects no seeds — a zero window per worker — and a narrower
#      one drops part of the window while every worker that did run passes.

# WI-A12's advancement + trace-completeness gate, landed BEFORE the threading it
# watches — the plan's binding sequencing rule. The script header carries the
# full rationale; what belongs here is why it is a separate target and not one
# more line in compaction_dst: every effect class A12 threads adds its
# assertions to this one probe, so the gate is named after the thing it guards.
#
# Verified falsifiable rather than assumed, by reproducing cluster 1's exact
# mutation: flipping the six dispatch carry sites to the carry-forward form
# type-checks clean (`✓ No errors found!`) and turns SEVEN assertions here red.
# The instructive half is what stayed GREEN under that total freeze — the
# one-RunSummary invariant and both determinism axes. Each axis is blind to the
# others' defect class, which is why the probe asserts all three.
#
# The target also carries A12's per-class POISON PAIR, D4's F3-corrected
# per-run backstop. Each effect class contributes two runs:
#
#   deterministic + capability withheld  -> must EXIT 0 (nothing reads ambiently)
#   live          + capability withheld  -> must EXIT NON-ZERO (it is load-bearing)
#
# Both halves are required. The first alone passes vacuously — a probe that
# completes with AI withheld proves nothing if no path would have used AI. That
# vacuity is cluster 4's C1b defect: a green check implying absent coverage.
# The poison script drives the LIVE provider and is invoked ONLY in the
# withheld configuration, so it terminates before any network call.
#
# A denied ambient effect terminates evaluation on the pin — no typed result,
# no partial trace. That is D6.6 and it must stay a raw non-zero run rather
# than being unified into a typed HarnessFailure.
#
# THE HOST-READ CLASSES HAVE A POISON PAIR AS OF WI-D3, and the note that used
# to stand here — explaining why the env class deliberately had none — is
# deleted rather than edited, because the thing it deferred exists.
#
# What it deferred: `src/core/context_usage.ail` read MOTOKO_MODELS_FILE /
# MOTOKO_REPO / MOTOKO_PROFILE_DIR / MOTOKO_CONFIG ambiently, and every one of
# those reads existed to compute a FILE PATH it then read ambiently too. Routing
# the env half alone would have handed back a world-supplied path to a HOST file
# — a run that passes an Env poison probe while still depending on ambient state,
# which is cluster 4's C1b defect. Completing it needed a filesystem class, and
# WI-A12's specified order did not contain one. WI-D3 added `Ports.file_read`,
# `WorldState.files` and `ContextReader`, and routed BOTH halves together.
#
# The note also undercounted: it said `resolve_context_limit` was called at six
# sites. It is EIGHT — six in session.ail and two in rpc.ail — and all eight are
# threaded now.
#
# TWO CLASSES, FOUR RUNS, and they share a subject on purpose. The deterministic
# half and the live half run the SAME session call; the only difference between
# them is which closures `ported_provider` bound. So a live run that dies where
# the scripted one completes locates the failure in the binding rather than
# somewhere in the driver, which is the argument the AI and Clock pairs make and
# the reason the pair is worth more than either half.
#
# MEASURED at WI-D3, both directions. At HEAD before the item, withholding
# either capability killed the DETERMINISTIC run, and short-circuiting
# `resolve_context_limit` alone made both pass — so it was the sole cause and
# the class is a point read rather than something wider. After the item, binding
# `live_ports.file_read` to `scripted_file` makes the FS-withheld LIVE run
# COMPLETE, which is what pins the live half's death to `ambient_file` instead
# of to anything incidental on the path.
#
# WHAT THE PAIR CANNOT SEE, MEASURED AT WI-D3 RATHER THAN ARGUED. Bind
# `scripted_file` so that it IGNORES `WorldState.files` entirely and ALL FOUR
# halves stay green: the deterministic runs still perform no ambient read, and
# the live runs still die on `ambient_file`. A poison pair is a statement about
# what a run does NOT read, and it is silent on whether the world is read at
# all. That is S16's shape — the two sides of the pair share no producer, and
# the property they establish is simply a different property. The
# world_state_probe assertions below are what catch it, and they went red on
# that mutant while every pair row stayed green.
#
# The env class ALSO keeps its provenance assertion in world_state_probe — the
# probe seeds MOTOKO_HEADLESS in the world and asserts the driver acted on the
# world's value, with a control run proving the two branches differ. That is a
# different claim from this pair and neither replaces the other: provenance says
# the driver read the world where it was asked to, and the pair says nothing
# else in the run reads the host. C4 ruled that provenance is not hermeticity,
# and it is still not.
#
# The poison entry point is `--entry main_host_class`, NOT a POISON_ARM value.
# `main` selects its arm with getEnvOr, which performs an Env read before it
# reaches any subject, so an Env-withheld run of `main` would die on the
# selector and report a non-zero exit that establishes nothing.

# D6's terminal-trace contract (WI-A9). Four checks, in order:
#
#   1. terminal_trace_dst asserts, over the trace the driver RETURNS, that every
#      drivable terminal path ends with exactly one RunSummary as its final
#      record and that the outcome agrees with it.
#   2. THE D6.6 DISTINCTION. A raw capability bypass must stay an expected
#      non-zero run — it must NOT become a typed HarnessFailure. A denied
#      ambient effect terminates evaluation on the pin, so no typed result and
#      no partial trace can exist. Withholding Env must therefore fail, and this
#      check fails if it ever starts succeeding, which is what would happen if
#      someone "unified" the two outcomes behind a catch-all.
#   3. A structural guard: every terminal return in the driver must go through
#      c2_finalize. c2_finalize holds the sole terminal record literal, so more
#      than one means a terminal path has been added that appends no RunSummary
#      — the exact regression D6.1 exists to prevent, and one that no per-path
#      test can catch for a path nobody wrote a test for.
#
#      WI-A13 stage 2 ANCHORED THIS GUARD, per cluster 7's correction 1. It was
#      a bare-token `grep -c` that counted comment lines too, so session.ail
#      carried a standing obligation to circumlocute around its own guard's
#      pattern in prose — the same landmine that turned `make world_state` red
#      for two clusters when A10 documented the randomness guard it tripped.
#      The pattern is now anchored to a line whose record literal is not
#      preceded by a dash, which no AILANG comment line can satisfy. Verified in
#      both directions: 1 at HEAD, and 3 against a file with two deliberately
#      added bypassing terminal returns in both plausible shapes, so the
#      tightening costs no coverage.
#
#      WI-B4 TIGHTENED IT A SECOND TIME, and for a different species. The
#      pattern is a PROXY for "a TracedSessionResult literal", and WI-B2b's
#      world token introduced a second record that also opens with `{ result:`
#      and is not one: `ExtAiStepResult` (its declaration, and the `ai_step`
#      bridge that builds one). The guard counted 3 and named a bypassing
#      terminal return that does not exist.
#
#      The discriminator is a FIELD, not a spelling: `TracedSessionResult` is
#      `{ result, trace, world }` and has no `next_state` field, while every
#      `{ result: … }` record B2b added has one. So lines carrying `next_state:`
#      — with the colon, which `world: reading.next_state` does not have — are
#      provably not terminal records and are excluded. This is a fidelity fix
#      rather than a silencing: it narrows on a property the terminal record
#      CANNOT have. Verified in both directions again, with the same two
#      plausible bypassing shapes: 1 at HEAD, 3 with them added.
#   4. The typed reason's wire mapping and result-class unit tests. session.ail
#      and phase_vocab.ail carry inline tests that no target ran before this
#      one, including the RunSummary goldens that pin the wire strings.

#
# Membership is DERIVED from D5's criterion on every run -- from the ExtPorts
# record, the core Ports record, and the extension-side bridge -- and never read
# from a list. D5's own enumeration named `ai_step` alone; WI-A12 falsified that
# by state-threading `Ports.tool_exec` and `Ports.env_get`, and a classifier
# built to the list would have reported a clean routing audit over two dropped

#
# `ext_call_inventory_selftest` runs the fixture suite: one fixture per
# indirection form the ADR places outside the matcher boundary, each of which

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# ADR-001 D4 clause 3, WI-A5: the site-to-hook attribution table.
#
# Two checks, because the fixtures and the artifact fail differently:
#
#   1. the fixture suite (scripts/dst/attribution_table_dst.ail) — every
#      rejecting shape, both directions of the empty-intersection rule, and the
#      set-completeness fixture that a row-shape validator would accept;
#   2. an ANCHOR check tying each row to the source it describes.
#
# (2) is not redundant with the staleness rule. Staleness compares recorded
# revisions and can only say "something changed"; this says WHICH row no longer
# describes its site. It deliberately does NOT compare `table_source_revision()`
# against git HEAD — the table is bound to the revision its rows were MEASURED
# at, and every later commit that touches nothing it cites leaves it valid.
# Comparing to HEAD would make the artifact stale on every unrelated commit,
# which trains people to bump the field without re-measuring.

# ADR-001 D1, WI-A11: the classifier-2 predicate documentation check.
#
# An anchor-set DRIFT check, not a containment check, and the choice is forced.
# The ADR records that its normative statements of the rule are "substantively
# aligned, not word-identical -- the six use six formulations", so a check
# requiring one canonical sentence at all six is RED ON THE UNMUTATED ADR by
# construction. Canonicalising them is six amendments this project does not
# budget and would destroy what each formulation carries.
#
# Every mention in the ADR's normative region is recorded with a paragraph hash,
# a classification (anchor = states the rule, reference = applies it) and a named
# reviewer. It fails when a recorded passage's text changes without a re-accepted
# hash, or when a mention appears that no record accounts for.
#
# Passages are matched BY HASH; the recorded line is a hint and a stale hint is
# reported, never failed on. A line-keyed check would go red on every unrelated
# ADR edit, which trains people to re-baseline it without reading.

# ADR-001 Amendment A, WI-D12: CLASSIFIER 3 -- the extension-closure
# ambient-source inventory. The fourth deferred gate mechanism, admitted
# 2026-08-06 by both acceptance reviewers.
#
# Answers criterion 2 by MEASUREMENT rather than by reading a declared row:
# per extension, whether every effect it can perform arrives through a field
# call on an `ExtPorts`-typed value. A declared row cannot distinguish mediation
# from ambience at any width -- the effect checker gives a port-mediated body and
# a fully ambient one the identical verdict -- so no row-reading instrument can
# stand in for this one.
#
# BOTH TARGETS ARE IN `make dst`, DELIBERATELY, and this comment is the reason.
# Classifier 1's degradation was invisible for thirty-three items because
# neither of ITS targets is: its self-test went from comparing 43 stdlib modules
# to comparing 1, on an unchanged tree, and both targets stayed green. Per plan
# rule S13, a gate outside the aggregate target degrades invisibly whether it
# fails loudly or passes vacuously. Do not move these out.
#
# CACHE PRECONDITION -- stated here, where the target lives, and not only in
# derive.py's docstring:
#
#   The producer is the compiler's own cached per-symbol interface data,
#   .ailang/cache/compile/modules/std__*/iface.json (schema ailang.iface/v1).
#   Every std module an extension's closure imports must have one.
#
#   The tool ESTABLISHES that itself, before deriving, by running
#   `AILANG_RELAX_MODULES=1 ailang check <package>/register.ail` for each of the
#   fifteen extensions -- so neither target depends on the other having run, on
#   `make dst` ordering, or on cache state a reader would have to guess at.
#   `--no-provision` measures what a cold tree would have answered.
#
#   This is the one thing classifier 1 could not do. Its producer needs the
#   stdlib-adjacent cache at ~/.local/share/ailang/std/.ailang/cache/, and WI-D11
#   proved NO repository operation rebuilds it: a 243-file cache-cold sweep
#   leaves it at 0 and `make dst` in full leaves it at 52. Measured two-sided at
#   WI-D12, this producer's cache IS rebuilt by the project's own compilation --
#   from every repo-local `.ailang` removed, the tool's own provisioning restores
#   resolution to 19/19 and reproduces the warm answer exactly.
#
# RESOLUTION IS REPORTED AS A FRACTION AND ENFORCED. Anything short of total is
# exit 1. A green run here means "every extension resolved AND these were
# clean"; it can never mean "the tool found nothing to look at". That
# `agree=0 disagree=0` shape has cost this project two items.
#
# `ext_ambient_inventory_selftest` runs the fixture suite: one fixture per
# unresolvable shape the ADR's acceptance criterion names -- module alias, bare
# module, missing cached interface, symbol absent from the interface, and an
# effect-VARIABLE row -- plus a sixth for a compiler builtin of unknown effect,
# which needs no import and which an import-only inventory therefore never sees.
# `compaction_structural` calls `_list_length` directly, so that door is not
# hypothetical. Each shape is paired with a RESOLVING CONTROL: a rejection-only
# suite is passed by a classifier that resolves nothing. The suite also pins the
# 4-of-15 yield in BOTH directions and asserts the fifteen package directories
# member by member, per plan rule S22 -- `scratchpad` lives at
# `packages/motoko_scratchpad`, so a directory-name resolver silently returns 14.

# WI-D15: the same criterion, quantified over HOOKS instead of over the whole
# closure. D5 (`ADR:1295-1300`) says "every hook reachable within that profile";
# Amendment A's property 2 says so too and then picks the transitive CLOSURE as
# the unit that makes the measurement total over hooks. The closure is a sound
# OVER-approximation, not an enlargement of the quantifier -- so registration's
# `std/env` and `std/fs` are inside the UNIT and outside the SCOPE.
#
# This REPORTS a second answer. It does not change `ext_ambient_inventory`'s
# verdict and no profile may rely on it: promoting it is an ADR-scope decision,
# drafted at WI-D15 and not applied.
#
# The split is REACHABILITY-granular, never file-granular, and the tree holds the

# WI-A17: the `ailang test` coverage axis.
#
# `check_core` type-checks src/core/*.ail and never RUNS their inline tests.
# `ailang check` coverage and `ailang test` coverage are SEPARATE AXES and only
# the first had a target -- cluster 4 found session.ail's 21 tests and
# phase_vocab.ail's 27 executed by nothing, and at the time this target landed
# fourteen more files carrying 74 tests were named by no make target at all.
#
# The enumeration is a RECURSIVE WALK, not a list of filenames. A list goes
# stale the first time a file gains tests and nobody edits it, and it goes
# stale silently; `check_core`'s own `src/core/*.ail` glob is the same bug one
# level down, which is why it never saw src/core/test/scripted_ports.ail or
# src/core/ext/runtime.ail. Every .ail file under src/core is discovered and
# run, so a new module is covered the moment it exists.
#
# EVERY RULE READS A COUNT, NEVER AN EXIT STATUS, and the reason is measured:
# `ailang test` prints "All tests passed!" and exits 0 when every test in the
# file was SKIPPED. src/core/prompts_test.ail is in that state at HEAD with six
# tests, and a target built on `ailang test X && echo ok` is green over it.
#
# Skips are tolerated by REASON -- read out of the runner's own JSON and
# recorded in tools/test_coverage/skip_reasons.json with a justification -- and
# never by filename, because a file list is the roster this target exists to
# avoid. A reason no record accounts for is red. Nothing here asserts an
# expected count for any file, so cluster 13's deliberate absence
# (fb_2ad074d754cd2c25 moved a flaky assertion out of a `tests` block on
# purpose) is structurally invisible to it rather than exempted by hand.
#
# It also wires scripts/probe_phase_vocab_sealed.ail WITH INVERTED POLARITY.
# That probe's FAILURE is its PASS: it imports phase_vocab's sealed
# constructors deliberately and the compiler refusing the import is the sealing
# assertion holding, recorded as such by project 004. The check requires IMP010
# NAMING A SEALED SYMBOL -- not merely a non-zero exit, which a syntax error

#
# `test_coverage_selftest` runs the fixture suite: one fixture per rule, each
