"""Derive the classifier-2 set and inventory its call sites (ADR-001 D5, classifier 2).

Classifier 2 answers two questions, and the second is worthless without the first:

  1. WHICH `ExtPorts` fields are members?  D5 states the criterion --
     "a field whose call is the extension-side entry to a core seam that D1
     requires to thread successor state, and which cannot return it" -- and then
     names `ai_step` as the only member with `clock_now`, `proc_exec` and
     `env_get` excluded.  That enumeration was true when written and WI-A12
     falsified it.  This tool DERIVES membership from the criterion every run and
     never consults a list, because a hardcoded list is a fail-open detector: it
     reports a clean routing audit over a cursor the ABI has started dropping.

  2. WHERE are they called?  A typed field-call inventory over `src` + `packages`,
     fail-closed on every alias, wrapper, re-export or computed access it cannot
     resolve to a typed receiver.

Membership is decided per `ExtPorts` field by three source facts, all re-read:

     a. the core seam the field fronts, found by resolving the extension-side
        bridge (`session.ext_ports_of`) through its closures and one level of
        named wrapper;
     b. whether that seam threads successor state -- its declared result type has
        a `next_state` field;
     c. whether the `ExtPorts` field's own result type can carry that successor.

  member       (a) and (b) and not (c)   -- a cursor is dropped at the ABI edge
  non-member   (a) and not (b)           -- the seam threads nothing to lose
  returns-it   (a) and (b) and (c)       -- widened; nothing is dropped
  unrouted     not (a)                   -- the field bypasses the core seam
                                            entirely.  Not a member (there is no
                                            entry to a seam), but reported loudly:
                                            `clock_now` is here by plan rule S2
                                            and the Clock poison probe is what
                                            covers it, not this classifier.
  unresolved   bridge unreadable         -- fail closed, exit 1.

Traps this tool is written against:

  * D5's non-member list is stale.  See above; membership is derived.
  * `env_get` and `clock_now` name BOTH an `ExtPorts` field and a core `Ports`
     field.  A bare `.env_get(` scan reports the core driver's own calls as
     extension seams.  Receivers are typed before they are counted.
  * comments and string literals mention `ExtPorts.ai_step` (dst_fault_catalogue
     has four).  Scanning raw text reports prose as an escaped function value.
     Source is stripped of comments and strings first.
  * `ailang iface` fails MOD010 on this repo's packages when handed an ABSOLUTE
     path and succeeds on a RELATIVE one -- the opposite of classifier 1's std/
     experience, and the error's two suggested fixes (`--relax-modules`,
     `AILANG_RELAX_MODULES=1`) are both rejected by `iface` itself.  Filed under
     ticket fb_d230853828108783.  `iface` is used only to confirm the ABI module
     parses; membership and sites come from source.
  * running from a temporary directory auto-relaxes MOD010 and hides that.
     Inherited refusal from classifier 1.

Exit codes: 0 clean, 1 unresolved membership or unresolved occurrences, 2 harness error.
