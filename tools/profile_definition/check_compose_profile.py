"""WI-D27's anti-transcription guard for the THIRD profile.

`check_fixtures.py` guards `driver_only`, whose install list is empty.
`check_no_op_profile.py` guards `driver_plus_no_ops`, which installs four
extensions that perform nothing. This script is the same discipline applied to
the first profile that installs an extension which PERFORMS SOMETHING, and every
check here is one that could not have existed before there was a mediated effect
to ask about.

WHAT IT READS, AND WHY NOT THE SOURCE. It takes the OUTPUT of
`scripts/dst/driver_plus_compose_dst.ail`, not the profile module. The profile is
a computed value — the classification entries are built by folding
`all_hook_slots()`, so the source text does not contain them — and a regex over
the source would be checking the constructor rather than the record. The script
prints one canonical line per entry, per installed package, per omission, per
disclosure, per registration source and per CLAIM; this reads those and compares
each against a producer that is independent of the profile.

THE SEVEN CHECKS. The second and the fifth are the ones with teeth, and neither
exists in either predecessor's guard because neither predecessor could fail them:

  1. installed set == {compose} exactly, and installed + omitted == every
     extension in `ailang.toml`'s `[extensions] packages`, with each recorded
     version matching the resolved one.

  2. **COMPOSE STILL HAS STANDING BARRIERS, AND THE PROFILE MUST NOT CITE A
     CLASSIFIER FOR IT.** Classifier 3 is re-run: if it reports compose anything
     other than AMBIENT, this profile's whole evidentiary argument has changed
     and must be re-decided rather than left standing. And no CLASSIFICATION line
     for compose may name `ext_ambient_inventory` — the producer that cannot
     clear it. This is the check that stops the profile quietly upgrading its own
     basis to the stronger-sounding one.

  3. each CLASSIFICATION line's criterion matches the ABI's rowed/rowless split,
     re-derived from `packages/motoko-ext-abi/types.ail`: a rowed slot may not be
     `effect_free`, a rowless one may not be `world_mediated`.

  4. the ONE excluded slot is the ONE gated slot, re-derived from
     `src/core/dst_profile_coverage.ail`'s dispatch table. D5 forbids excluding
     an unconditionally-dispatched hook, and this profile is the first that
     excludes anything at all.

  5. **THE DEMONSTRATION HAPPENED AND WAS NON-VACUOUS.** Every criterion-2 entry
     names `discovery`, an EXISTENTIAL producer whose evidence is a run, so the
     guard requires the run's own CLAIM line and requires it to carry at least
     one origin-tagged extension effect, the same count reproduced by the replay,
     and zero mismatches. A profile citing `discovery` with no run behind it is
     the fail-open shape `basis` was added to close, and this is where it fails.

  6. the registration DISCLOSED lines match classifier 3's own ambient-source
     list for compose: every source the profile discloses must be one the
     instrument found, and every {Env, FS} source the instrument found in
     compose's registration files must be disclosed.

  7. the computed STATEMENT is the mediating branch and names a non-zero count.

Per plan rule S16, the enumeration for each new scan is in the function that
performs it, and every unenumerated shape reads as FAIL rather than as absent.
