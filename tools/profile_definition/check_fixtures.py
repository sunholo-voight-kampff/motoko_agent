"""WI-A10's anti-transcription guard for `make profile_definition`.

The profile machinery composes facts that other artifacts already computed. Most
of those it reads directly at runtime, in AILANG, so they cannot go stale. Two
cannot be read that way, because they are derived from the SOURCE by a Python
tool rather than declared in an AILANG module:

  * classifier 2's membership set and its `unrouted` set
    (`tools/ext_call_inventory/derive.py`), and
  * which member call sites belong to an INSTALLABLE extension.

Those enter the AILANG fixtures as literals, and a literal is exactly what goes
stale silently — both readings type-check and the wrong one is quiet. This
script is what makes them not stale: it re-derives each one from the tool and
from `ailang.toml` and fails if the AILANG side disagrees.

Three checks, and the third is the one that matters:

  1. the recorded classifier-2 set equals the tool's, member for member;
  2. the recorded unrouted-field set equals the tool's. An unrouted field is a
     DISTINCT state, not a non-member -- treating it as a non-member would
     silently bless an extension reading an ambient clock. `clock_now` was the
     only member until WI-C5 widened it to thread the world token, so the set is
     EMPTY at HEAD and this check is currently vacuous; it is kept because the
     next un-widened seam re-populates it, and because an empty set that is
     re-derived is not the same claim as one that is assumed;
  3. every member call site that lives inside an installable extension package
     is named in the AILANG fixture's classifier-2 call list, so the fixture
     cannot omit an extension that the tool found and stay green.

Check 3 is what stops `driver_only`'s omission list from being a guess: the day
a second extension calls a state-threading seam, this goes red rather than the
profile quietly claiming coverage it does not have.

    called `ExtPorts.ai_step`, `ai_step` was a classifier-2 member, so the list
    could not silently drop it. B2b widened `ai_step` to return `AiStepOutcome`.
    It left the classifier-2 set, `member_call_sites` went empty, and check 3
    became VACUOUS — it now passes because it requires nothing, which is
    indistinguishable from passing because everything is right.

    The omission is still correct, but its basis moved from classifier 2 to D5's
    coverage criterion read on DECLARED effect rows.

    ===================================================================
    THE BASIS MOVED AGAIN AT WI-D6 (2026-08-06), AND THIS GUARD FIRED TO
    MAKE IT MOVE DELIBERATELY.
    ===================================================================

    WHAT THIS GUARD USED TO ASSERT, and it was correct from WI-B4 until
    2026-08-06 — kept here in the past tense per plan rule S15 rather than
    rewritten, because it is a record of why the omission stood for five items:

        `ExtensionHooks.on_budget_plan` is unconditionally dispatched, declares
        a NON-EMPTY effect row, and returns a type with no successor field.

    Rows are closed, so that row was not a property of any one binding — every
    implementation in the tree declared exactly it. `Env` and `FS` are not
    world-mediated ports, so criterion 1 failed on the declared row;
    `BudgetPatch` carries no successor, so criterion 2 failed for want of
    returned world state. D5 forbids installing an extension with any
    unconditionally-dispatched hook excluded, so no extension was installable at
    all and the empty install list was FORCED.

    The docstring said this would go red the day `on_budget_plan` was widened,
    "which is exactly the day the omission has to be decided again rather than
    inherited". WI-D6 NARROWED it instead of widening it, the guard fired
    anyway on the same clause, and the omission was decided again. That is the
    guard working: it did not care which direction the row moved, only that the
    basis had changed.

    WHAT THIS GUARD ASSERTS NOW. The polarity of the row check is INVERTED:
    `on_budget_plan` must declare NO effect row. The other three clauses are
    unchanged, because they are still true and still load-bearing for a
    different conclusion.

    AND THE CONCLUSION IS WEAKER, WHICH IS THE POINT. `driver_only` still
    installs nothing and still covers nothing — but the empty install list is
    now CHOSEN rather than FORCED. A chosen emptiness covers exactly as much as
    a forced one. What changed is that a future profile CAN install an
    extension; this one still does not, and that is a decision this file
    records rather than a consequence it derives.

    """WI-D7. THE INSTALLABILITY QUESTION, DERIVED RATHER THAN ASSERTED.

    THIS CHECK EXISTS BECAUSE THE LINE IT REPLACES WAS FALSE. Through WI-D6
    this file printed, on every run:

        → the slot is coverable under D5 criterion 1, so an extension IS
          installable

    and it does not follow. `on_budget_plan` was ONE of FOUR unconditionally
    dispatched slots. D5 forbids installing an extension with any
    unconditionally-dispatched hook excluded, so ALL of them must be coverable
    before any extension is installable, and the other three were not. D6's
    report and its design-document edit inherited the same wrong conclusion;
    `dst_driver_only.ail` stated it correctly at the same time, and the two
    disagreed with nothing going red. That is what this function fixes: the
    count is now DERIVED from the ABI and the dispatch table on every run, so
    no artifact can carry a stale answer to it.

    THE RULE, read straight off D5: a slot is a BARRIER when it is
    unconditionally dispatched AND declares a non-empty effect row. A non-empty
    row fails criterion 1 outright. It could still pass criterion 2, but only
    if every effect in it is a world-mediated port — and none of the effects in
    any of these rows is. So a non-empty row on an unconditionally-dispatched
    slot is a barrier, and the count of barriers is the number of things
    standing between this tree and an installable extension.

    WHAT GOES RED, AND WHY THAT IS THE POINT. If the count reaches ZERO, an
    extension becomes installable and the omission has to be DECIDED rather
    than inherited — which is WI-C5's trigger, not an ABI edit's side effect.
    This is B4's guard shape, which WI-D6 recorded as the standard: pin the
    FACT, not the direction, so the check fires whichever way the row moves.

    =========================================================================
    RE-SHAPED AT WI-D13 (2026-08-07): A BARRIER IS A PROPERTY OF THE
    (EXTENSION, SLOT) PAIR, NOT OF THE SLOT.
    =========================================================================

    Everything above is RETAINED and still computed — see `slot_barriers`
    below, which is that derivation unchanged, and the trigger on it unchanged.
    What follows is a second, finer derivation over the same inputs plus one
    more, and the reason it exists is that the coarse one CANNOT ANSWER THE
    QUESTION IT IS ASKED. ADR-001 Amendment A states it (`ADR:1580`): the rule
    above reads the ABI row and the dispatch table, both per-SLOT facts shared
    by all fifteen extensions, while D5 criterion 2 is a claim about a hook of
    an INSTALLED extension. The old derivation cannot tell one extension from
    another, so it answered every extension's question with one number.

    THE THIRD PRODUCER, and it is why the finer derivation is possible now and
    was not at WI-D7. `tools/ext_ambient_inventory/derive.py` — classifier 3,
    built at WI-D12 — decides PER EXTENSION whether every effect it can perform
    arrives through an `ExtPorts` field call, over the extension's transitive
    module closure. It is the only producer in this tree that can supply
    criterion 2's evidence, because criterion 2 is a claim about the CALL PATH
    and every row-reading instrument is blind to provenance by construction
    (`ADR:1449`). Per S16 it is a genuinely separate producer: it reads imports
    and call names, never the declaration being tested.

    CRITERION 2 IS A CONJUNCTION OF THREE CLAUSES (WI-B4 read it that way and
    was right; reading it as one test is how it gets passed):

        (1) effectful only through D1 world-mediated ports
        (2) with origin tagged by extension id
        (3) and explicit world state returned to the host

    and this derivation clears a barrier only when it can discharge ALL THREE:

        (1) classifier 3 reports the extension PORT-MEDIATED.
        (3) the slot's OUTCOME TYPE carries an explicit `next_state` field,
            read from the ABI's own type declaration rather than assumed.
        (2) classifier 3 reports ZERO `ExtPorts` field calls in the closure, so
            there is nothing to tag and the clause is VACUOUS.

    Clause (2) is the fail-closed one and the honest one. This tree has NO
    producer for "is this port call origin-tagged" — WI-B4 established that
    `PreStepStage = { ext_id, outcome }` tags `on_pre_step`'s dispatch, and that
    is one slot read by hand, not a derivation. So this check does not clear a
    barrier for an extension that actually calls a port: it refuses, and says
    which clause it cannot discharge. The consequence is stated rather than
    discovered, and Amendment A predicted it (`ADR:1611`): **the first hooks
    this clears are ones that PERFORM NOTHING, not ones that mediate.**

    CRITERION 1 IS NOT AVAILABLE HERE AND IS NOT USED. In substance these hooks
    are effect-free, which is criterion 1's text — but criterion 1's basis is
    the DECLARED ROW (`ADR:1415` records it as an assumption), the declared rows
    on these slots are non-empty, and a named binding cannot declare narrower
    than a closed ABI slot. Amendment A deliberately WITHHELD criterion 1 from
    its scope, so admitting a measurement there is an ADR-scope act and not this
    file's. Every clearance below is criterion 2.

    WHAT GOES RED AT THIS GRANULARITY. The slot-level trigger above is
    unchanged. The new one is its (extension, slot) analogue and has the same
    shape: an extension whose barrier count reaches ZERO is INSTALLABLE, and
    that must be DECIDED rather than inherited — so it must be accounted for by
    name in the profile, either installed or omitted. Naming it is not a
    coverage claim; INSTALLING it is, and that is WI-C5's.
