"""Classifier 3, HOOK SCOPE -- the sharpened unit WI-D15 measured.

WHAT THIS IS, AND WHY IT IS A SECOND ANSWER RATHER THAN A REPLACEMENT
---------------------------------------------------------------------
ADR-001 D5 (`ADR:1295-1300`) quantifies criterion 2 over HOOKS: "every hook
reachable within that profile is either ... effectful only through D1
world-mediated ports".  Amendment A's property 2 (`ADR:1484-1490`) opens with
the same quantifier -- "Criterion 2 quantifies over every hook an installed
extension registers" -- and then picks the extension's transitive module CLOSURE
as the unit that makes the measurement total over hooks.  The closure is a sound
OVER-approximation of hook reachability, not an enlargement of the quantifier,
and the ADR already labels it as such at the yield paragraph: "The coarsening is
*conservative*, so it is the right direction, but it caps the instrument's reach
at four extensions."

So `register.ail`'s `std/env` and `std/fs` are inside the UNIT and outside the
SCOPE.  This module measures the scope: what an extension's eight hook bindings
can actually reach.  It does NOT change `derive.py`'s shipped verdict, because
what a profile may record on is an ADR-scope question and this is an instrument.

THE FILE IS NOT THE SPLIT, AND MICRORAG IS THE PROOF
-----------------------------------------------------
The obvious sharpening -- drop `register.ail` from the closure -- is FAIL-OPEN
and this tree contains the counterexample.  `motoko-ext-microrag/register.ail`
holds `microrag_tool_handle`, which is BOUND TO `on_tool_handle` and reaches
`std/fs.writeFile` and `std/process.exec` through `auto_write_with_microrag`.
Dropping the file clears microrag of two ambient sources a hook really reaches.
`register.ail` is not "the registration module".  Measured over the fifteen:
NINE hold the `ExtensionHooks` record itself, so every inline hook body lives
there, and SIX go further and declare named top-level hook functions in it.
Dropping the file drops hook-reachable text for nine of fifteen extensions.

The split is therefore REACHABILITY-granular, computed from the eight bindings
outward, and every step it cannot resolve is a rejection.

THE DOORS, ENUMERATED BEFORE THE UNIT WAS CHOSEN (plan rule S16, as WI-D12
extended it).  An effect reaches a hook by exactly these routes:

  1. an effect-bearing `std/*` symbol applied in text the binding reaches;
  2. a `_`-prefixed compiler builtin applied there -- WI-D12's door, which needs
     no import;
  3. a NON-underscore language builtin applied there -- `show` is one, it is
     applied in six of the fifteen closures, and NO producer at HEAD carries a
     row for it.  This door is NEW at WI-D15 and `derive.py` does not watch it;
     see `unknown-callee` below;
  4. a call site inside a STRING INTERPOLATION.  `strip_noise` blanks string
     literals to keep prose out of the scan, and `"${show(n)}"` goes with them.
     Measured over the fifteen closures: 10 builtin calls and 2 effectful std
     symbol calls live only inside interpolations.  None changes `derive.py`'s
     import-granular verdict -- but this module is CALL-granular, so for it the
     lid is a fail-open.  `keep_interpolations` below is the fix;
  5. a hook bound to something this tool cannot resolve to text -- a computed
     expression, a threaded value, an unresolvable delegation.  A rejection;
  6. an effect performed at REGISTRATION whose result a hook closes over.  This
     is out of criterion 2's scope by the reading above and it is NOT harmless:
     it is reported separately as `registration_only`, and what accounts for it
     is D5's disclosure obligation, not this instrument.

Verdicts: HOOK-PORT-MEDIATED | HOOK-AMBIENT | HOOK-UNRESOLVED.  As in the parent
tool, unresolved is a rejection and never a pass, and a green answer can never be
produced by resolving nothing: the binding tiling is asserted before the walk.

#: DOOR 3, AND WHY IT IS REPORTED RATHER THAN CLOSED.
#:
#: `derive.py` classifies `_`-prefixed builtins and nothing else.  An identifier
#: like `show` -- applied, needing no import, declared nowhere -- is therefore
#: neither resolved NOR rejected by the parent tool: it is not looked at.  For an
#: import-granular verdict that costs nothing.  For a call-granular one it is a
#: hole, and `show` is applied inside `compaction_structural`, the extension the
#: second profile's entire criterion-2 coverage rests on.
#:
#: Closing it needs per-symbol effect data for language builtins, and NO PRODUCER
#: AT HEAD HAS IT.  The parent's evidence rule -- a std export whose cached row is
#: a closed empty row proves its direct callees effect-free -- cannot reach these
#: names, and WI-D15 measured both halves of that:
#:
#:   * every `show(` in the 46-module stdlib corpus is inside a `--` COMMENT, so
#:     no cached row anywhere carries evidence for it, interpolation-aware or not;
#:   * a textual scan for the general case cannot tell a language builtin from a
#:     higher-order PARAMETER applied in a std body.  Tried at WI-D15 and
#:     discarded: it resolved `f`, `p`, `pred`, `get`, `put` and `cas` as
#:     "language builtins", classifying `f` EFFECTFUL and `p` PURE.  A rule that
#:     invents evidence is worse than one that reports its absence.
#:
#: So an unresolved language builtin is `unknown-callee` -- a REJECTION -- and the
#: names are reported as a named RESIDUE with the counterfactual yield beside
#: them, labelled as a counterfactual.  This is the same shape as Amendment A's
#: condition A-1, which names classifier 1's broken producer dependency rather
#: than working around it.
