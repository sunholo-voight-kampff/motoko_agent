r"""The `ailang test` coverage axis (WI-A17, ADR-001).

`make check_core` type-checks `src/core/*.ail` and never RUNS their inline
tests. **`ailang check` coverage and `ailang test` coverage are separate axes
and only the first had a target.** Cluster 4 found `session.ail`'s 21 tests and
`phase_vocab.ail`'s 27 executed by nothing; at the time this tool was written,
fourteen files under `src/core` carrying inline tests were named by no `make`
target at all.

**The enumeration is a recursive walk, and a list of filenames is the defect
rather than the fix.** A list goes stale the first time a file gains tests and
nobody edits it, and it goes stale silently. So every `.ail` file under
`src/core` is discovered by `rglob` and run, and the coverage question is
answered by construction instead of by a membership test against a hand-kept
roster. `check_core` globs `src/core/*.ail` -- one directory, no recursion --
which is exactly why it never saw `src/core/test/scripted_ports.ail` or
`src/core/ext/runtime.ail`. A single-directory enumeration reproduces that bug,
so `fixtures/nested/` exists to keep the recursion asserted.

## What is authoritative, and why there are two derivations

Test counts come from `ailang test --format json`, which reports
`total_tests`, `passed_tests`, `failed_tests`, `skipped_tests` and a status per
test. That is authoritative in a way a grep is not.

A grep is kept anyway, and the two are **cross-checked per file** (S8). The
handoff that commissioned this work proposed deriving "carries inline tests"
from `^\s+tests \[` alone. A file whose tests use a form that pattern misses
drops out of such an inventory **silently**, and a file that has dropped out
reads identically to a file that never had tests -- the same failure as a
pinned digest certifying only the paths its trajectory walks. That is not
hypothetical here: `src/core/prompts_test.ail` carries six tests in `test
"..."` block form and matches `^\s+tests \[` zero times, so the commissioning
measurement did not list it. `src/core/compress.ail` gets two more tests from
`requires` contracts, which no `tests`-shaped pattern can see.

So the rule is not "trust the grep" and not "drop the grep": it is **the two
derivations must agree, per file, every run** (`undetected` / `phantom`). A
form the pattern misses is now RED rather than absent.

`requires`-derived properties are deliberately NOT in the syntactic pattern. A
`requires` clause is a contract, not a test, and AILANG generating a property
from it is a behaviour this tool does not want to assert. A file carrying only
`requires` therefore trips `undetected` -- which is correct and loud, and is
the direction that fails safe. Putting `requires` in the pattern would instead
risk `phantom` on any contract that generates no property.

## Counts, not exit statuses

`ailang test` **exits 0, and prints "All tests passed!", when every test in the
file was SKIPPED.** Measured at HEAD on v0.26.0: `src/core/prompts_test.ail`
reports `6 tests: 0 passed, 0 failed, 6 skipped`, `"success": true`, exit 0.
Six tests certify nothing and the exit status says they are fine. A target
built on `ailang test X && echo ok` is green over that file.

(The complementary claim -- that `ailang test` exits 0 on a file with ZERO
tests -- is false on this pin: `total_tests: 0` sets `"success": false` and
exits 1. That is the reason a file with no tests must be recognised and passed
over rather than treated as a failure.)

Every rule below therefore reads a NUMBER or a per-test STATUS. None reads the
process exit code.

## Skips: recorded by REASON, never by filename

A skipped test is lost coverage, but not every skip is a defect this repo can
fix, and cluster 13 established that an absence is sometimes deliberate --
`fb_2ad074d754cd2c25` moved a flaky assertion out of a `tests` block into an
acceptance script on purpose, and an inventory that flags that produces a false
positive, false positives get relaxed, and a relaxed inventory is the
hand-maintained list this tool exists to avoid.

The resolution is that **nothing here asserts an expected count for any file**,
so a deliberate absence is structurally invisible to it; and skips are
tolerated by **REASON**, read out of the runner's own output, never by
filename. `skip_reasons.json` records each tolerated reason with a
justification and a disposition. Any skip whose reason is not recorded is red
(`unrecorded_skip`), so a NEW kind of skip cannot arrive quietly.

A record marked `expected: always` that matches no skip in the run is also red
(`stale_skip_record`): either upstream implemented the feature and the tests
should be switched back on, or the tests were deleted. Records marked
`expected: sometimes` are non-deterministic by nature -- a property whose
precondition is usually unsatisfiable may occasionally be satisfied -- and a
stale one is REPORTED, never failed on, because a flaky gate gets relaxed.

**What this tool deliberately does not catch:** a file that had tests and lost
all of them. Both derivations agree on zero and no rule fires. Distinguishing
that from a legitimate deletion needs an expected count per file, which is the
hand-maintained list again. The boundary is stated rather than papered over.

## Rules

Each is separately named so a self-test row can assert ITS OWN rule rather than
"something was reported" -- cluster 14's third mutant sampled one member twice
and omitted another, keeping a length check green, and was caught only by
membership-by-name.

Exit codes: 0 clean, 1 findings, 2 harness error.
